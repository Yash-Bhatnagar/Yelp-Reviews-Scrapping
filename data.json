{"This is my absolute favourite Thai restaurant inToronto downtown.It takes some time to get a table, but worth the wait. The staff is friendly and the food is good.Pad Grow Prow - 8.5/10 a little over saltedPad See Ew - 10/10I would order Pad Thai and Pad See Ew next time": "positive", "It's Pai - you know it's gonna be good! My all time favourite Thai place in Toronto. I will always keep coming back. The only reason I don't come back as often as I'd like is that it's hard to get reservations and it's really popular so I don't want to wait in line most of the time. Make sure to come early if you're doing walk in. My top two favourites are the beef salad (so flavourful) and the pad Thai (so delicious). The pad thai is seasoned so well, I can't eat any other pad thai in Toronto": "positive", "Not sure what the hype is about. the food here was very mediocre at best. \u00a0here is what we had and thought:garlic shrimp - oktom yum soup - goodkhao soi with braised beef - okgreen curry with fish - barely edible thai ice tea - just oki don't recommend and don't plan to eat there again": "positive", "An authentic experience for some hard to find thai dishes. Reservations recommended but walking also possible with a little wait. The venue is quite big so they can churn out new seatings fast. They have your typical Thai dishes but also some unique dishes that you won't find at other Thai restaurants. The Chiangmai beef noodle soup had an excellent broth but the beef was a little tough. The beef salad was reasonable. The pad krow pow was excellent and they also gave up some fresh peppers to adjust the spicyness to our desired level. Massaman curry hit it out of the park. Pandan cake was fluffy and not too sweet which is what I like. It took a little to get out entree but the waiter did apologize but we had our huge glasses of Sapporo to bud the time. Overall it's a low end 5* just making it pass the 4 mark": "positive", "An easy 4.5 stars. One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to outside of Thailand.We sampled the Green Curry, Panang Curry, Pad Thai, Moo Ping, Chicken Wings and Tom Yum soup. I'm not going to go through a play by play. Everything was fantastic and I would put your fate in their hands. Order anything on the menu. You won't be disappointed": "positive", "Yum! Stopped by for some Thai food and was not disappointed! Definitely make a reservation because there was a huge line during lunch time. Got the Thai chicken wings as an appetizer. Three fried chicken wings topped with crispy shallots, lemongrass, and crispy chillies with a sweet tamarind sauce ($6). Definitely nice and crispy. For the main, I got the shrimp green curry ($19.50) which came with jasmine rice. Green curry with bamboo shoots, makrut lime leaves, basil leaves, and coconut milk. Topped with Thai basil and red pepper. Loved the presentation - the curry came in the coconut and also in a bowl - there was so much food! My friend got the Tom yum soup and it was also served with rice. It was quite big so she got half packed to go!": "positive", "Whenever I spend a night out in downtown Toronto we always want to eat Thai food. This city has some of the best restaurants. We dropped by here around 6pm and there was a waiting list. You can request to be seated at the bar if you like the bar vibe.As you walk through the restaurant you will smell the aromatic curries, pad thai, noodle dishes, \u00a0fried squash fritters, spring rolls, etc. The Northern Thai platter looked so yummy. I will definitely order that next time.We ordered the Khao Soi and Gaeng Massaman. Khao Soi is fresh egg noodles in a golden coconut milk curry. It was just a bit too salty for my liking but I really enjoyed the curry broth. The protein \u00a0of choice was beef brisket. There's also crispy deep fried noodles served on top kind of like garlic bread with pasta. 4/5Gaeng massaman is a peanut tamarind curry also with choice of protein or tofu veggie. The curry had a little sweet kick to it. The rice was wrapped in banana leave and served on the side. \u00a0The serving of rice should be bigger as most of us like to pour some curry on top of the rice. Otherwise the dish was pleasing for the palate . 4/5Service was exceptional we didnt have to wait for a table as we were given a seat at the bar. The bartender and servers were all friendly and attentive. They asked me if I needed help with the menu. \u00a0He was able to explain some of the dishes to me on the menu. Menu are scanned by phone using QR codes. Next time I will study the menu and pick out my next dish I want to try. There are so many options to choose. If you want to take a trip to street food in Northern Thailand give this place a try you won't regret it": "positive", "Our group of four had gone here right before Ontario started its QR codes for vaccinated people.Regardless this Phai on Dundas in Toronto's DT was hard to get a table without long waits on a Saturday evening. Luckily, we reserved weeks in advance.It's simple and had a good vibe.$-$$": "positive", "Ended up at Pai after reading countless reviews on it and seeing that they made really authentic Northern Thai food. I am a lover of asian food, especially Thai food so it was a no brainer that I try this place out. I ended up getting takeout food - and even when I went for pickup there were countless people around waiting to get their food which means its very fresh (which it was).I ended up trying:*Green Curry chicken - delicious and flavorful and came with lots of chicken and a side of rice which was nice* Pad see ew - came with tofu and lots of veggies, this dish really hit the spot*Penang curry - came with tofu as well - I enjoyed this more actually because I really like the peanuty curry like taste alot. Am a personal fan of this!*Papaya Salad - all the flavors you want in a delicious, refreshing salad. Everyone who tried this in the house, loved it!Overall, food was good - definitely expensive for the quantity, but I guess \u00a0that's due to downtown and the popularity": "positive", "Visited Toronto for the weekend and a friend recommended we had to come here. We came around 4:30p before the dinner rush and put our name down, it was only about a 30 min wait and they texted us when our table was ready. When we came back, the line for the waitlist became pretty long.We ordered:- grabong - moo ping- tom yum soup - pad thai- khao soi- green curry- coconut sorbetOur top choices were the grabong (squash fritters--one of their most popular items), moo ping (pork skewers) which were super juicy, and coconut sorbet! The Tom yum soup is pretty spicy! I can only handle mild spice so this was way too spicy for me. We ordered the khao soi with braised beef and green curry with chicken. The pad thai was nothing special in our opinion but I like that you can get mixed protein so we ordered ours with shrimp and chicken. My absolute favorite was the coconut sorbet which comes with fresh coconut shavings incorporated in the sorbet. The peanuts were a nice touch and an added texture/flavor that somehow complimented the whole thing very well and the tart mangos balanced the smooth milky flavor of the coconut sorbet.All in all, a great spot. I would come back JUST for coconut sorbet though. It's pretty large so order to share!": "positive", "Good Location | Authentic | Quick ServiceI visited Seven Lives pre pandemic so read this review under that lens. Located in Kensington market, this place has really made a name for itself. You know someone who has either been too or knows someone who has gone to Seven Lives. Unfortunately I'm never in this area so this was my first and only time here. I got the shrimp taco and it was fantastic. It came out hot and the shrimp was well cooked. Topped with crema and red cabbage which added the perfect creamy and tangy bite. I appreciated that they had a few \"serve yourself\" salsas on the side. The taco was double shelled which really helped with the eating integrity of the whole experience. I really appreciate the rustic simplicity of the restaurant. Nothing crazy except great quality food. Thinking about it really makes me want to make the trek downtown just for my taco fix": "positive", "I'm new in town and heard about this taco spot that everyone has been raving about. Being someone who lived in Southern California by the Mexican border, I frankly walked in with high expectations.I ordered 3 tacos - the Gobernador, Carnitas, and Pulpo. Unfortunately, due to the current dining restrictions in place, I could only take them to go. Although they were definitely not the best tacos I've ever had, I thought they were still pretty good and flavorful.The shrimp that came with the Gobernador was cooked perfectly and had a really nice texture to it. The Carnitas was super juicy and the guac was rich and creamy enough to my liking. The worst of the good bunch was the Pulpo. Despite being cooked well, it was kinda bland overall and did not pack the punch that I was hoping for. All in all, the tacos were quite greasy as well but not to the point where everything would disintegrate completely.At $7 per taco, the food leans towards the pricier side. However, Seven Lives serve the best tacos in Toronto by some margin, at least for me. Highly recommend if you happen to be in the area": "positive", "So every time I would look up what to eat in Toronto - this little Taco spot named Seven Lives would always pop up. I knew if I was ever in the area I would have to give this place a shot to try out, and I am so glad I did! This is a small joint, which we almost missed while on the way but were able to find it. Once inside there were people in there trying foods and we ended up trying two tacos. We got the baja fish taco and the octopus taco. I loved the sauce and the taste of the octopus taco - the meat was definitely well grilled. However, the real superstar was the Baja Fish taco. This was perfectly fried and the thin batter was absolutely delicious. Every bite I had was amazing. I would highly recommend one try this place out!": "positive", "MMMM tacos!! And this place does it BIG!They moved locations to a smaller storefront across the street, so we ended up wandering in circles as Google Maps isn't yet updated.We ordered the mushroom and cactus, as well as the carnitas (pork). The carnitas was good - the tortilla was absolutely stuffed to its brim with shredded pork. If you're ever craving for something meaty, this is a top contender. The mushroom and cactus is a vegetarian option but so packed with flavour! It was my first time having cactus - I expected a flat piece of leaf and didn't realize it came shredded and pickled. The taco itself is quite oily, with the caramelized onions and mushrooms, and grilled queso blanco (resembling smoked, meaty halloumi).Overall, a great and satisfying meal!": "positive", "Craving Tacos and Seven Lives is usually my go to option. Came here for lunch on a Sunday, I used to come to Seven Lives a long time ago when they were still across the street at their old location. The new spot is a lot bigger but due to the current situation, they don't allow dine in. The vibe and aesthetic is lively. There's a lot of art and deco.For the food, this time I got the Gobernador and Blackened COD. I usually order the Gobernador when I come here. It is a taco with smoked tuna and grilled shrimp. The Blackened COD is, as you guessed it, grilled COD. During this visit, I feel like something is missing and its not as satisfying for me. And for the price (which increased from what I remember), I don't feel like I got value for my buck. To be fair, it's still good but makes me want to explore other options nearby. Will the king for my go-to taco spot be dethroned? Who knows. Overall, I would still recommend this place hands down. But if you're looking for value and to be satisfied, perhaps get 1 taco here and go elsewhere": "positive", "Super fun to try! The tacos were incredibly flavourful (however we picked up our order late and by that time the tortilla was super soggy). We got 6 tacos for a total of around $48. $7 for a single taco is a bit on the pricier side, however it's worth a try at least once (taking 1 star off for the price)Our order:1 gobernador2 baja fish1 Camarones a la diabla1 Blackened ahi1 Carne asada The baja fish was incredibly delicious and probably one of the best tacos I've ever tried. Blackened ahi was not the best as the fish was a bit too sweet for my liking": "positive", "Small shop on Kensington. No dine in available. Both tacos are delicious \u00a0the price is very reasonable": "positive", "I got the baja fish, pulpo a la Mexicana (grilled octopus) and of course their famous Gobernador! The Gobernador ($8) had marlin fish and shrimp \u00a0and it was exploding with flavour (but it fell apart while walking, hence the messy photo). Overall, 9/10 for the gobernador.The baja fish ($7) and octopus ($7) tacos were good but not great. I expected more from those two since this spot is super popular and the tacos are pretty pricey. I would give a rating 7.5/10 for both the baja fish and octopus tacos!": "positive", "This spot is excellent. We got the Pulpa A La Mexicana and the Saturday Braised Beef special tacos, alongside with the weekend special Ceviche and some Mandarin Jarritos. Notably, the quality of the tacos were excellent. The beef and the octopus were especially amazing. The ceviche was also refreshing. It was however a bit hard to properly eat it from the cup with the chips. Overall, it was an excellent experience and I would recommen this place for all tacos lovers": "positive", "I've been eating at Seven Lives for years and I've always loved their tacos. It's hard to write a real review of a place that currently only offers takeout (there is no dining in allowed). This is a the pollo tacos and they are absolutely freaking delicious. That being said they seem to now offer their tacos on only a single small tortilla (they used to put two tortillas) which makes them kind of really exceptionally messy to eat. I really wish they sold burritos because it really would be better if they could add the filling to a large burrito tortilla. The only reasons this is not a 5 star review is: its kind of lame they won't allow indoor dining (they are a very busy place they can afford someone to check vaccine ID's, they skimp on the second tortilla on a huge taco) but that's the only things I can fault them on": "positive", "Had a fantastic experience in terms of both food and service. Here's what we got: * Salmon Oshizushi (Torched Salmon Sushi) * Saba Oshizushi (Torched Mackerel sushi) * Spicy Maguro (Tuna Tartare)* Salmon Tataki (Salmon Sashimi) * Ikapiri (Calamari ) * Ebimayo (Prawn ) * Karaage (Fried Chicken ) * Lychee Mojito \u00a0Everything we got was super yummy \u00a0but the salmon sashimi , tuna tartare and calamari stood out to us the most! Will definitely be coming back for more": "positive", "+.5 for serviceThis is the original Kinka, way before Izakaya restaurants became cool in the GTA.I went with a few friends in my September visit to Toronto. Kinda sad it took till now for me to finally try this place, as I've tried most of the other Kinka branches in the GTA already...however it was always busy for the longest time and I didn't feel like waiting 90 minutes for a table.I wasn't too hungry that night so I only had a salmon oshizushi. It's decent, but considering the hype behind this place I may have expected more. It could also be because the izakaya game has stepped up a lot in recent years, and this place is starting to lag behind a bit. Perhaps I needed to try more items to get a better sense of what the strengths are for this Kinka branch. I can see myself returning as I have a couple friends who work nearby and this is a popular meetup spot by them": "positive", "Hadn't been here for probably 6 years? So i was looking forward to trying it again when my friend suggested it, but it wasn't as great as I remembered. Probably around a 3.5 for the food. A few of the things we tried to order on the menu, were unavailable that night (or sold out). Some of the things we did get really weren't that great. Both the karaage and calamari arrived cold. The calamari actually tasted like cold and soggy sweet and sour pork? \u00a0The tartares/oysters were okay. The udon and the bibimbap were really good though, our favourites for the night. Service was very friendly, and the atmosphere is always great. Portions are definitely meant to be small as it's tapas style--but for the taste, frankly i'm not sure if its worth it for me to come back": "positive", "Wow this place is still around! I remember trying them in my college days and I kept trying to mentally add up the bill in my head because I was too broke as a student to splurge. Their food is still amazing! Yes the portions are small because it's like tapas but the quality of the food is so good! We got some super fresh salmon and mackerel sushi, crispy fried shrimp with mayo and an udon dish to share. It's a great spot to hang with friends since izakayas are a bit louder and no grimey sticky tables here!": "positive", "Came here for late night snacks. Had tako wasabi, sashimi and soup udon. Same as other Kinkas, service was nice.By the way I felt bad about broken their POS machine, hope they've fixed it by now": "positive", "I thought it was a decent. Went for dinner with a few friends and they had great seating options (both indoor/outdoor) and even got seating for our large group of 10! The interior was nice as well and staff seemed super friendly! Food wise, I tried the sashimi salad ($15). It was alright. There wasn't much fish and it was kind of pricey. The presentation was good however. the food overall was pretty expensive and didn't stick out in particular or anything. However I did hear some of the fried stuff was good but I didn't really get a chance to try them. Overall it was OK but I wouldn't come back for a dinner but that's just my personal preference. Seems like it could be a nice place for a snack or late night hang though": "positive", "Kinda Izakaya is absolutely phenomenal! The food is amazing and it honestly feels like you're eating at a Michelin star restaurant, but at an affordable price. I highly recommend this place to anyone! I've been here twice and my favourite dishes has to be the salmon pressed sushi and the beef udon, although everything tastes amazing. If you come here you have to do a sake bomb (it is super fun especially when you come here with lots of friends!!). Make sure you book a reservation first as it is super busy. I honestly don't have any complaints about this place, if anything the service is a bit slow during their peak hours but it's so worth it. I think this is the perfect place if you love good food and want to have a fun night out with your friends, and for the quality of food you're getting it is actually pretty cheap (most plates are about ten dollars). Hope to come back soon!": "positive", "Kinka is the place to go when you're looking for a rowdy Izakaya. The staff is extremely friendly, and they all like to have fun!We were recommended Kinka by one of my husband's friends on our first trip to Toronto, and it did not disappoint. We love to walk whenever we go on vacation, and it wasn't too far from our hotel. We were greeted by a loud chorus of \"hellos\" when we walked in, and only had to wait about 20 minutes \u00a0to be seated. For our first visit, we had the Wagyu Tartare, Hamachi Sashimi, and Ebi Tempura. Everything was made to perfection. Tartare is hard to find down in Michigan, so we order it whenever we see it on a menu. The Tartare at Kinka was served with a quail egg, and the meat melted in our mouths with every bite.Yellowtail is always a favorite, and I don't have much to say other than it was good, and the slices were thicker than I thought they would be. Light, refreshing flavor with yuzu sauce served on the side.Ebi Tempura - I'm generally not a fan of Tempura, but the breading on this wasn't too thick and the Ebi was fat and juicy. My husband really enjoyed this!For drinks, we split a Sake that was served in a hollowed out Bamboo Tube, and our cups were made out of bamboo, too!On our second visit, we came with my husband's cousin to celebrate my husband's birthday. I asked Kinka if they did anything special for birthdays, and they offered us a flight of shots. We thought that it would be just for my husband, so imagine our surprise when they brought out 9 shots of Sake, 3 different types for each of us to drink! They also came out with a birthday sign and took a Poloraid picture of us to bring back home. It was an epic night for us to remember": "positive", "Amazing sake bombs and fun times! Authentic Chicken Karaage. Can be a bit loud but that's the whole point": "positive", "I have been to kinka Izakaya over and over again through the years. Great for large parties before lockdown and for take out. The atmosphere has always been so fun friendly and loud. Always a great time there. I always enjoy the tasting menus and kinkalicious as well. My go to are the mushroom cheese stone pot rice, salmon oshizushi, takoyaki, karaage and the baked oysters with cheese": "positive", "Always hits the spot - savoury and flavourful Kim chi fries and grilled pork banh mi are my go tos": "positive", "This is definitely the place to go for a great Banh Mi. If you've never had banh mi before you must try it!! This place has amazing flavour and greatPrices. The sandwiches are packed with delicious fresh herbs and pickled veggies making the sandwich fresh and savoury.This is a must try!!": "positive", "I always come back for the Kimchi fries. The kimchi, \u00a0pork belly and special dressing they use is amazing. Once you have that you don't need to eat for the rest of the day!": "positive", "This place is so awesome. I love that they've taken tacos and baos and elevated it with tastier fillings. Every time I'm downtown this is my go to fast food spot. I love and would recommend the squid taco, kalbi taco and the pork belly bao. It's a pretty casual place with some seats so I'd recommend this spot for just a quick and easy meal": "positive", "Not sure if this is a one off thing but I always enjoyed Banh Mi Boys. But can't say the same thing when I went today.Ordered 3 Steamed Baos - Five Spice Pork Belly/Fried Chicken & Braised Beef. Both Pork Belly and Beef were dry af and the pork has a weird taste. \u00a0The fried chicken was already soggy when I went home. Considering my place is just less than 5 mins from BMB, this shouldn't have caused the sogginess but rather how they wrap the food tightly.Overall I didn't really enjoyed the Baos and would think twice before coming back here again": "positive", "First time trying banh mi boys and won't be the last time for sure. I got the lemongrass tofu banh mi and my partner got the five spice pork banh mi. We also shared the spicy chicken bao which was really amazing. We asked that they make everything spicy and they added jalapenos. All our food was fresh, flavorful and really good. The bread was really good quality and was crunchy after we got back our food home. The sandwiches are pretty huge! My tofu banh mi really treated my senses - the lemongrass scent was as amazing to taste as it was to taste. The food is extremely affordable - all that food for about $20 is really great for a Toronto place! The store itself felt small and it looked like it was mostly for take out. Overall, a happy customer and will be back for good quality and delicious food!": "positive", "Banh Mi Boys has always been a treat when coming down to the city. While the prices are on the higher end of banh mi, the amount of filling and fresh produce used is worth splurging from time to time. The flavours are bold and well balanced, and each component of the banh mi works well in there. The sauces are a nice addition and completes the sandwich as a whole. Overall worth coming from time to time, and a great meal on the go as well": "positive", "I loved how they had vegetarian/pescatarian options for banh mis. Usually I'm limited to what I can eat so I really appreciated the squid and tofu banh mis!": "positive", "I've been at this joint many times and they've never disappointed. The workers are very polite, and the place is well managed. The sandwich is really good, especially the Grilled chicken Banh-mi. I'd really recommend them if you are around Queen west": "positive", "Visited last year, for a quick bite while walking around Downtown Toronto. I tried the fried chicken bahn mi bao and all I can say is... it was perfect. Juicy, crispy chicken, soft and chewy bao bun, and crunchy flavorful toppings like cucumber, carrots, jalapeno and cilantro... yum. I'll be dreaming of this sandwich until I have the pleasure of eating it again": "positive", "Must Try: Duck Liver Pate, Scallop Crudo, Duo Duck, Stn BurgerRating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness Experience: One of the best restaurants in Toronto for delicious comfort food. Their menu rotates from time to time, but the small menu offers enough variety that everyone will find something they will love. I've always wanted to try their Chef's Prix Fix menu, but they require the whole table order it, so we often opt to order off the menu so that we can try new and different things. The appetizers are the real stars here, as they are unique in both flavour and presentation. We absolutely love the scallop crudo and the duck liver pate as they are very fresh and have a special distinct flavour. Their mains are fantastic, though a bit more regular than the offerings of their appetizers.Whether coming to celebrate something special or just looking for a nice delicious meal, Richmond Station definitely delivers!": "positive", "5/5 Richmond station is one of my Top 10 favourite restaurants in Toronto. They have the best ingredient and excellent hospitality. Every dish has its unique flavours and is presented very beautifully! Each week their chefs curate a unique Multi-Course Menu. \u00a0It's such a perfect way to experience Richmond Station. I have tried their chef menu a few times and every time was great! They also offer beverage pairings for Chef's menu. It's a good deal! If you love drinking, you should go for it! \u203cThe unique thing about Richmond Station is that they are a Hospitality Included restaurant! \u00a0That means the prices we see in the menu include the cost of service!!! Isn't it a great idea? \u00a0So, We don't have to think about how much we have to leave tips for the service and we know exactly how much we have to pay for the meal. Besides, their employees get paid well and don't have to rely on the tips to survive! \u00a0If you plan to visit, I would recommend you make a reservation ahead of time, especially when you have a party of over six people! Highly Recommend!": "positive", "Have always heard great things about Richmond station over the years and I finally made a visit this week. We made reservations for dinner and there is an option to do a la carte or the tasting menu. We opted for a la carte and I tried the Organic Chicken Ballotine. The dish was super nicely plated and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I loved the hollandaise sauce, so delish!!! \u00a0 I was also enjoyed the mushrooms \u00a0and gnocchi to compliment the chicken. The service was good and the restaurant ambiance makes it a great place for dinner! Interesting note as well is the dishes include consideration of gratuity, etc so no need to tip on top. Dishes were a bit pricier but I felt that the ingredients were perfectly curated and worth the splurge! I can't wait to come back and try the tasting menu": "positive", "Definitely the best place in town for a fancy-ass burger that's medium rare. If you hate burgers this place will turn you. It's like you're eating steak tartare as a patty that sinks under your teeth and melts in your mouth. The station burger is the standout... other dishes are hit or miss": "positive", "I don't know how Richmond station is still doing it but they are still perfect even as takeout.I ordered a variety of things from here for my birthday and was blown away how delicious everything was.There charcuterie board and cheese boards were still delightful and had such a good variety of flavors. I also really liked everything that accompanied it.The duck liver mousse was so smooth and satiny And the scallops and curry with cauliflower were cooked perfectly somehow and the curry was flavourful without being overpowering.The cavatelli with a hen of the woods mushrooms was fabulous. This was probably my favourite part of this specific meal.They also were doing beautiful bottle cocktails I got the milk punch. If you've never had milk punch I highly suggest you try it. It sounds really strange but they are such delicious cocktails and I love how they're clear yet have a certain roundness to them on account of the milk. I highly suggest checking out a YouTube video of how a milk punch cocktail is made. It's really interesting": "positive", "I was in Toronto on a business trip and my boss and I went to Richmond since it was one of the only places that could take us. If you're going to order anything, order the SLOW- ROASTED BLACK COD. I died and went to fish heaven! It had charred sweet corn, mushrooms, and mint. Tied so well together. Richmond was such a good find! ENJOY!": "positive", "2 years after my initial review, I have to admit, my first visit may have been an off day. I ordered take out and got the station burger which was amazing. I will definitely be back for this! We split the fries and the polenta fries. Polenta fries were super crispy this time and cooked to perfection. The rosemary fries come with a delicious sauce too, switch things up from your regular fries.The only downside was I got a message from ritual our order was ready but we had to wait 10-15 minutes longer. Although, they did offer us a couple free house made kombucha for the inconvenience so they did handle this accordingly. After this experience, I will definitely be coming back. Redemption for Richmond Station!": "positive", "If this wasn't the best burger I have ever had, it is in top 3!Even though I ordered online, the presentation was great and the burger came in a good shape. The cheese was perfectly cooked and the burger was seasoned well. The bun was amazing, probably one of the best buns I have ever had. I asked them not to put onions because Im not a fan of onions anyway haha. But I should say, given its location, and the quality of food, this restaurant deserves to get 5 \u00a0and the only negative point is I'm sure I'll be craving for this burger again later on today Well done Richmond Station!": "positive", "Good food and has a great reputation, although I think they take themselves a bit too seriously.

I've heard so much about Richmond station and nothing but good things. I came in with really high expectations but everything about this restaurant just blew my mind. The food was top notch and the service was even better than the food. Overall the experience combined was probably one of the best dining experiences in Toronto. Can't wait to go back to check this place out post covid!We did the tasting menu and everything was incredible. Side note: please order ahead of time if doing the tasting menu. We got lucky and was able to order it at the table. Usually you reserve ahead of time. It was such an interesting experience because every ingredient complimented each other so well. Things that I never would have thought to put together in one dish. All the respect goes out to these talented chefs. I can't say there's one particular dish that we liked the most, each was so unique. One thing is for sure, the next time I'm back, definitely trying their famous burger": "positive", "I've always held Middle Eastern food very close to my heart, as one of my favourite cuisines that I grew up eating a lot of. In Toronto, as much Middle Eastern food as we have it's been tough to find truly excellent restaurants among the crowd - especially when it comes to combining authenticity with an upscale / experimental menu, which Byblos does well. Years ago when I first came here I thought it was unauthentic and underwhelming, but after coming here again I can safely say they've made massive strides to getting it right. Starting with the cocktails - I tried The Businessman which is a very refreshing version of the old fashioned, and the Mediterranean Mule (usually made spirit free, you can add your own) which was delicious in its use of date syrup - wish they would use this in more cocktails!Here's the rundown of the food: - Manti Dumplings: the obvious star of the entire show. Steaming little pillows stuffed with eggplant served in a wonderfully creamy and savory yogurt / date molasses sauce - this was one of those dishes that fills you up in your soul, and gives you a feeling of coziness all up in your insides.- Hummus Royale: smooth creamy hummus with plenty of wagyu beef on top, this went great with the fluffy barbari bread and made for a wonderful bite. - Lamb Ribs: fall off the bone lamb cooked to perfection, again using the date molasses and served with a chili sauce that made for some explosive flavours - Tomato & Cucumber Salad: fresh, quality ingredients with lots of cheese - was a solid dish, though I wish it had more olives - \u00a0Black Truffle & Cheese Pide - this was just average to me, it was a good savoury bite but lacked the explosive flavour I was expecting; might've been nice with more sumac. \u00a0- Short Rib Kebab: not your typical kebab, this one was almost like a mini prime rib - the meat was succulent and juicy with a truffle yogurt sauce and was a great hit- Fried Chicken: perfectly crunchy on the outside, and soft and juicy on the inside - this was textbook, and I loved that it was served with all the side including pickles, turnips, tahini, red schug, and even a ranch sauce with sumac. Plenty of sauce combos to try! - Branzino: perfectly grilled, love that they didn't try to do too much with this one and let the quality of fish speak for itself - and boy did it speak. - Sweet Jeweled Rice: not like your typical tahdig, but with plenty of flavour and texture throughout. I really love sumac in my rice, but the saffron really sparkled here so that was still a win.- Saut\u00e9ed Greens: some staple greens nicely seasoned with herbs and cheese, this one felt healthy and delicious, and made me feel a lot better about eating that fried chicken. - Baklava: this dessert came with 9 pieces so it was a great one to share, and the white chocolate sauce was a perfect way to take a decent baklava to the next level. Overall, would say this was truly an excellent meal, even for my lofty standards of Middle Eastern food. My only qualm is I wish I had some pictures to memorialize it! Byblos has come a long way since I last tried it a couple years ago and they've taken their food from good to great. The service was excellent too, as they were great with recommendations / customizations and coursed everything out well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a big dinner, and can't wait to come back for those dumplings!": "positive", "Food 4.5/5.0Service 4.0/5.0Value 3.0/5.0Decor 4.0/5.0Overall 4.5/5.0Very nice spot in the Entertainment District. Hard to get a Friday evening rez. Food was excellent, though a bit pricey. Would come back": "positive", "still a solid 4 stars a few years later. The food continues to be fantastic and I really wanted to give a 5 star but a few things threw the experience off. The good: food continues to be spot on. fried eggplant is a MUST order and the braised rib kabob lived up to all the other reviews. the turkish dumplings are rich and great for dipping bread. The roast beet is a nice light appetizer. Truffle rice has a good truffle flavour and lots of mushroom to add a nice texture.All packed with flavour.The not so good: The truffle pide was literally expensive cheesy bread... there was no truffle flavour and it was served lukewarm. Didn't enjoy this at all and would not recommend ordering this.The service seemed a little scarce...likely due to the pandemic labour shortage and lots of new staff as well as not enough staff. We're normally not very picky but I think the entire floor had only 2 or 3 servers.The missing lamb shoulder: we tried ordering this (as well as the tables beside us) but were told they only had large portions costing $200... huge disappointment especially since lamb shoulder could be carved apart...Inflation: Lots of dishes have experienced a pretty significant price hike (especially when I compare to my review 3 years ago!). Probably to make up for the increases in labor/food costs and the losses from the pandemic closures. Most dishes that were previously $14 are now $20+. Expect to spend about $100 per person depending on what you order & appetite. Definitely a nice place to eat with a cozy atmosphere": "positive", "What a great celebration we had at this restaurant. The food was spectacular. I can't say more except GO! The atmosphere was lively and the setting lovely. Make your reservations well in advance - you won't be disappointed!": "positive", "Good eats, nothing unique. \u00a0Overall the roasted lamb shoulder was the best, everything else was ordinary. \u00a0Dishes are small for the price and there is not a big taste to them. \u00a0Probably about a 3.5, gave them a four": "positive", "So I want to say that I wanted to love Byblos as much as everyone else. I was really excited to try this place out. The service was great. Our server was very attentive. I deducted one star for the expensive price for what the taste & portion size was and another for the ambiance of the patio. The patio did not have much decor in the sense that it made you feel like you were elsewhere rather than a side walk. I expected more from this higher end restaurant. Favourite dishes of the night:-Black truffle Pide: flat bread with truffle cream. Can't go wrong with truffle. -Short rib kebab: it's sort of like char siu (Chinese bbq pork) but so tender and melts in your mouth. Dishes that coasted in the middle:-Duck Kibbeh: okay flavour. Nothing mind blowing. Nothing new. Pretty expensive for only 4 pieces. -Lamb Ribs: I found this to have little meat on it and not really tender.Would not order again:-Middle eastern fried chicken: it's like a better quality version of KFC or Popeyes but severely lacked in flavour.-Mocktails: rose's shadow (bland berry-lemon soda), Mediterranean mule (it's like Coca Cola with a lemon as my friend described it)": "positive", "***This review is for delivery so I kept the rating but will give comments in review***Given that I live in Mississauga and can no longer easily access downtown in the pandemic, I miss Toronto food significantly. In fact, I've had cravings for Byblos in the past year. So, you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to learn that they were doing delivery via UberEats to Mississauga!!!I figured the food wouldn't last as well given the long commute, but it ended up pretty decent! There were a few dishes that didn't travel well, mainly the manti (cooled a bit and therefore lost its comforting charm), lamb ribs (again, cooled slightly so it was sweeter and stickier), and the pita (the condensation caused certain parts of it to become wet and moist; however, it was still quite soft and very warm!). The highlights were the roasted lamb shoulder - it was so nice to be able to make your own personalized wraps - and, of course, my favourite fig salad!A detailed review is as follows:Roasted lamb shoulderDon't be fooled by the appearance - this big fist-sized serving of meat is one chunky baby! The meat is packed tightly so it's very hefty. The gamey flavour is unmistakable, and the pickles and dips really helped balance and accentuate the profile. In fact, having the pickled radish on its own was not great, but combining it with the gamey lamb was delicious! Would definitely recommend. Fig saladUnsurprisingly, the salad wasn't affected by the long delivery commute. It was still as good as I remember! The sweet floral citrusy taste whet my appetite, combined with the tangy cheese, and I adored the crunch from the seeds and nuts.MantiFrankly, the manti was what I was most excited for - oh, how I adore Byblos' manti dumplings! Unfortunately, they cooled down a bit (and in my eagerness, I didn't heat them up) so the yogurt flavour was far more prominent. Still good with lots of complex flavour, but not amazing. Lamb ribsThese sweet, sesame coated ribs were yummy, despite having cooled. Again, in retrospect, I should've heated them up at the time, but they were still nonetheless delicious! A bit on the small side, however - each rib was as long as my index finger with not a whole lot of meat. Black truffle uffle pide and riceThis pide was good and still warm when it arrived. The dough was a little chewy but the earthy truffle flavour really came through. The rice was quite hot, despite the hour drive, but alas, the crispy onions and chickpeas on top had deflated. Don't be fooled by its small appearance; it's quite filling!Wagyu hummusOf all the dishes, this was the least impressive. The hummus was good, but it had a grainy texture. The minced Wagyu was also a bit tough - didn't seem like wagyu, frankly": "positive", "They cancelled my reservation last minute for a birthday dinner. Said they'll book my reservation for their sister restaurant instead and never got back to me. Won't be back": "positive", "Nice ambiance, and fairly good food. All \u00a0of the portions appear to be tapas sized, but very filling. In conclusion it's a great spot for an intimate or group setting, but keep track of the quantity of shareables as they will quickly rack up the bill": "positive", "Came here during COVID. \u00a0everyone wore masks, and there was lots of hand sanitizer. Ambiance/Service: (4 stars)The tables are separated from each other, and can fit about 6 people, anything more would be hard to accommodate. Due to covid they were pretty understaffed but the waiter kept running around trying to make us have the best experience possible .Parking: (5 stars)There is free parking at ImPark lot at 211 Adelaide Street. \u00a0You do need to call the restaurant beforehand so they can register you. \u00a0Even with the registration, we ended up getting a ticket. \u00a0I went back to the restaurant to complain, and the manager just took a picture of the ticket and said he will handle it and we do not have to do anything about it. \u00a0GREAT serviceFood (5 stars):For 6 of us we ordered the following: (we wanted to get octopus as well, but they ran out)- Turkish manti dumplings $16 - (5 stars) - This is absolutely my favorite thing on the menu, it is creamy and full of flavour.- lamb ribs $21 - (4.5 stars) - this was a portion of 4 ribs, the ribs were coated with sesame seeds, and were very delicious and unique.- roasted lamb shoulder (for 2) $65 - (5 stars) - this came with make it your self tacos. \u00a0(6 tacos that you would have to stuff to the extreme with all the meat) The meat was full of flavour and juices.- Woodfire pride: wagyu lahmeh $17 - (4.5 stars) - a pizza like - middle eastern fried chicken $21 (4 stars) - it was juicy, not my favorite thing on the menu, but others liked it- Black Truffle Rice: roasted mushrooms + cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche $25 (4 stars). \u00a0I am generally not a fan of rice but like this.With wine the bill came to $300 before tip for 6 people": "positive", "The ice cream isn't horrible, but there are plenty of ice cream shops in the city that are far superior without line ups. Bang Bang's bread & butter is the instagram crowd that take photos of ice cream smashed between pastries, cookies, waffles... unicorns? If you are just looking for good ice cream try summers, Ed's real scoop, or Barocco x Nino": "negative", "People in Toronto won't shut up about this ice cream place soooo I had to try it even though the weather was cold & my hand froze while I ate the ice cream \u00a0The Mud flavor is hella good if you like coffee \u00a0The other flavor I tried was the Miso & it was definitely a unique one. In a good way \u00a0I totally wish I had more time to come again and try more flavors. \u00a0I'm all about creative flavors so i'd say must visit when in Toronto": "negative", "Long lines are a good indicator of a good business with a product worth waiting for. Bang Bang is exactly that. A 10-15 person strong line will take about 20 minutes in our experience but during that time you get a chance to scroll their digital menu and go through several stages of FOMO. We ordered the Cinnamon Bread Pudding and it was like eating a cinnabon cloud with creamy ice cream. We couldn't decide on the flavor of ice cream and the girl let us mix our flavors which I really appreciated because holiday season is arriving and it feels like every meal is a gazillion calories. I highly recommend trying this ice cream out!": "negative", "Let me just begin this review by saying that I've tried to come here MANY times over the past 3-4 years but every time I did there was a HUGE line up spanning 2 blocks. Absolutely insane. So after 3-4 years of pent up hype I really had high expectations of this place. How can their ice cream be THAT good that the hype never died down for this place? So finally, this summer I planned a trip downtown Toronto so that I would go when the Bang Bang would have JUST opened - YET THERE WAS STILL A LINE UP! Incredible.But I can finally say I tried their ice cream and the one flavour that truly stood out and confirmed to me that this place could not only talk the talk but walk the walk was their London Fog. 100% would come back and would recommend": "negative", "A Toronto staple! Everyone loves this place and for good reason. I'm obsessed with their taro flavour that I bought a pint of it after getting an ice cream puff. I always come back from time to time, so happy they're still open despite the weather getting colder!": "negative", "The ice cream is SO GOOD! I visit Toronto at least 3-4 times a year since my in-laws are here and we discovered this ice cream spot recently while exploring downtown and it was absolutely fantastic! The lines can get pretty long so just beware - carve out a 15 minute wait minimum if you go during peak hours. I've tried their ice cream cookie sandwiches and one of their stuffed pastries that come with pineapple ice cream and both were absolutely SUPERB! Highly recommend trying this spot if you're in downtown Toronto looking for a good ice cream spot!": "negative", "I've been here a few times pre pandemic, and I really miss this place! This ice cream shop has some of the most delicious flavors I have ever experienced. My favorite are the London fog (earl grey) and totoro (taro). I also really like the cinnamon toast one and the matcha. You can get these in a bubble waffle, which makes it extra fun.In the 3-4 times I've been, there has always been a line out there door. Granted I have always gone in the summer time on a Saturday afternoon. I cannot wait to go back to Bang Bang when it is safe again! Until then, I will dream of my favorite flavors. Highly recommend coming by if you are ever in the area. You will not be disappointed, the wait is ALWAYS worth it!": "negative", "Summertime is here! Regardless if it's summer or winter, there is always a line at Bang Bang Ice Cream. There's not only alot of choices in flavours, but there's also choices that you can have to go along with your ice cream Witt profiteroles, cookies, sugar cone, cinnabuns, and more ... Always a hard decision. But I can honestly tell you, you can't go wrong with any flavours that you choose, cause all of it tastes equally delicious. If you intend to get the egg waffle with ice cream combination, be prepared to wait even longer, since it takes a longer time to make the egg waffle. Nothing beats ice cream, especially when summer is around and here!": "negative", "Delicious ice cream. I love the variety of flavours as well as the waffle cone. The prices are fair and I think the portion sizes are good. Will likely come back just for the icecream but also a fun place to visit on a hot summer's day!": "negative", "First time at this place to get some ice cream and I'm glad I came right before it opened up because that line grew quickly. \u00a0BY the time it opened it was already 3 blocks long. My main complaint is the menu has no prices and it feels awkward asking the price for every single option available especially with the huge lineup behind; by the time you know it you've spent $10 on one ice cream sandwich.However, the ice cream here was great and very flavourful. I got the Mango and orange cardamon with all that sandwiched in between a classic chocolate chip cookie. The cookie reminded me of the ones from subway that was soft and gooey.The menu is constantly changing but I'm sure you'll find a flavour you enjoy whenever you go": "negative", "Can anything warm and satisfy quite like a large bowl of noodle soup? Tasty bowls of ramen with all the flavour and topping options that your heart desires. If you're a fan of spicy food and brave enough to try it, get a side order of their spicy paste. I forget what it is called, but you'll want to nab some before it runs out. I was lucky to get the last order of it on my last visit": "positive", "Amazing Ramen! \u00a0We had the red dragon, spicy miso (not spicy) and vegetarian red miso. Also the takoyaki. The last item was meh. Nothing against how they make it. I think takoyaki is overrated. The batter to octopus ratio is too high and there is way too much mayo on it. Did I mention the ramen?!Go there. Eat! gochisousama deshita!": "positive", "I came here with my husband for some hot food before attending a concert nearby. I am so incredibly happy that we did!Although the food is on the pricier side, this is by far the best vegan ramen I've had in Toronto. I was somewhat disappointed that they charge extra for rice noodles but I was still very impressed by how flavourful the broth was! My husband and I both finished our entire bowls and were very impressed with how amazing our vegan ramen tasted.The restaurant gets very busy in the evenings and it's definitely on the smaller side. We were seated near the back of the restaurant and it felt very cramped. I'm not sure how we would have fit appetizers and drinks if we had ordered them, since the table was that small. The staff were very friendly though and attentive.Parking can be annoying as it would be street parking. However, it's only a very short walk away from the nearest TTC stop!": "positive", "PRO TIP: make sure to get on their waitlist to minimize how low you will need to wait in the coldThey don't accept reservations and it's very popular. My boyfriend was smart and went on Yelp to be put on their waitlist for an 8pm seating for two on a Saturday night. The app told us to arrive at 7:50pm. We ran late to find parking (there's a Marshalls/Food Basics underground parking that is relatively close by).We arrived at 8:10pm and saw a long line of others waiting. When we went in to see where we were in line, they told us that we were next, and they were preparing the table for us and could wait inside vs. the cold November outdoors.I'm pretty sure that we ordered, ate, and paid before a larger party of 5-6, who was waiting outside when we first arrived, was seated.Ordered items in my photos. They were delicious! My favourite was surprisingly the Chicken Karaage. Please do your taste buds and stomach a favor and order a dish of the chicken karaage. You won't regret it.Finally, I agree with all the good things said by others. Their staff were great!": "positive", "I was visiting the Toronto area and was told if I like ramen this was the place. Wow! This did not disappoint. Its a small restaurant with a small open kitchen. Anticipatr a wait because the ramen was incredible! The portion size, the presentation and our tofu appetizer was fantastic. I will be back!": "positive", "I came here on a busy Friday night. \u00a0Had to wait a bit it the wait was worth it \u00a0 I had the spicy miso ramen and it was a 5 star. \u00a0 The service was excellent and it felt like I was in Japan. !! \u00a0I'll be back": "positive", "Visited Ramen Isshin at College street after a long day shift at the hospital and at around 8pm peak time I was seated in the patio which bypassed an hour long waiting list indoors. The staff are very attentive, accommodating, and kind. The \"Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen\" is now my new favourite ramen! Thanks!": "positive", "Second time at isshin and their tsukemen has won me over! The noodles had a good bounce and the dipping broth was thick and flavourful. The appetizers were bit underwhelming and I recommend skipping": "positive", "OMG so much yum at this place! \u00a0Authentic Ramen almost as good as the Michelin star ramen restaurant I ate at in Honolulu. \u00a0 Highly recommend!": "positive", "Food: The tonkotsu ramen here is always good, I usually stick to ordering one of their top 3 ramen and was never disappointed. This ramen shop offers vegetarian ramen as well! They offered seafood okonomyaki in the past which I sincerely miss eating. A good substitute or side to get is the takoyaki, as it is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Service & atmosphere (pre-COVID): Nice seating, I usually come here solo and they have seating facing the wall for people who eat by themselves. This place can get pretty packed and line ups are common. Pricing: Two dollars signs": "positive", "Been going there for the last 8 years and food has been consistently fantastic! The owner is super nice. What can I say more that others haven't already! It's my favourite Thai restaurant. The Tom yum soup is the best I have ever tasted.. Red curry, green curry, Khao soi, Pad gra prao are all fantastic. I'm not a fan of their Penang curry, as it's on the dry side": "positive", "It's hard to know if this place perfectly recreates the flavours I remember from Thailand, or if this place is packaging the flavours that best pull on every mnemonic thread that I have associated with Thailand. At the end of the day, that doesn't really matter, though, does it?The food here is something delicious. \u00a0Good Thai food can be a risk, and a challenge to find. \u00a0And, I think that's because everyone has their own desires, and everyone is looking for something that connects with them in the way they remember, or the way they want to remember, or the way they think they should remember if they had the chance to experience it.All that is to say: if you like Thai food, you need to - at least - give this place a chance. \u00a0It might become your favourite after only one bite": "positive", "One of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto: be ware that they usually have a line up.

It was super busy, and because we did a walk-in, we had to wait a while. I ended up getting the Three Flavours Pad Thai ($17.50). Although it does not look like much, it is actually quite a bit of food! The flavour was good, but my personal opinion is that I have had better Thai food downtown. I also would have preferred a bigger alcohol selection, as the other Thai places offer better selections.AMBIANCE | I love the interior of Khao San Road! I love the tiled walls, and the tables were appropriately spaced out, unlike other places that disregard the rules for social distancing.SERVICE | Service was on the slower side. Understandable because it was a larger crowd, but I think restaurants should be prepared for this traffic by bringing more employees in.VERDICT | I would recommend other Thai places downtown... I personally prefer SukhoThai and Pai!": "positive", "I've been to khao san road before the pandemic and I remember it to be much better. The apps came out very fast, garlic shrimp was very good but the steak salad and fresh rolls were only ok. It was lacking in taste and flavour. I felt like I could make better fresh rolls at home..... the pad Thai tasted like any other pad Thai, nothing special. The pad si ew was very good. However It took a very long time for the mains to come out because they were very busy. Nothing was outstanding so I don't think I will be back": "positive", "OMG! I don't know how I missed on writing review for Khao San Road :OThis is by far the best thai place I have encountered in Toronto. We use to walk here from our apartment in downtown. Its a small place but lovely crew. Super tasty food. They do not take reservations thats what I know from a couple of months back (things might have changed). But be here a bit before you are hungry, might have to wait. Theres a bar upstairs which is pretty great to hangout as well": "positive", "We've been waiting to try this new Thai restaurant for a while. Great atmosphere and delicious food. Good thing this restaurant was only 10 minute walk from Rogers centre.Every dish had a distinct aromatic flavour especially the steak salad. The use of mint, coriander, parsley, lime juice made this dish a symphony of flavours. Green curry had an amazing coconut creme broth which I was able consume it like a soup. We asked for medium spice but it still packed \u00a0a serious punch. For people sensitive to spice request it to be mild.Three flavours pad thai was by far the best pad thai dish I've had in my life.

This is my intro to tell you that I can't tell you the difference between the khao soi i got here vs the one at Pai. In any case, they were both good!!I got the Khao Soi with beef to-go and it was definitely filling. The noodles came with a slice of lime, and then the soup and crunchy toppings were packed separately. When I first opened the noodles, I felt like it was a small portion. But by the time I finished, I felt like it was the perfect amount - i think the generous soup portion definitely filled me up quite a bit. I also got the garlic chicken which was good. The chicken itself had a seasoning before it was coated in panko which i appreciated. This dish also came with a sweet and sour sauce that I think complemented the dish quite well.Overall, I think this was to par with other thai places i've been to. Is it AMAZING?!?! I'm not sure. But if i was craving thai food again, I think I would go to this again- but maybe it's a little on the pricier end": "positive", "Delicious! I've dined here a few times over the years (and in their old location as well) and my go-to entree is always the massaman curry w/ beef. I believe they can also make it with tofu or chicken. See picture. It's so savoury and off the charts tasty. The potatoes and beef is perfectly done and the curry itself is brilliant. It's also a pretty filling portion for one person. I would love to give Khoa San 5 stars but the service was somewhat slow but given covid times and the issues across most of the restaurant industry with hiring I can't really hold that against them specifically. I would just suggest checking their menu out in advance and putting in your food and drink orders in as soon as you are seated": "positive", "Khao San Road has moved to another location across from 25 Charlotte! Their food is still so delicious and after being away for so long, our server was on the ball and we really enjoyed her service. 3 of us got the Khao Soi with proteins and 1 pad Thai for my other girlfriend. Before ordering mains, we ordered squash fritters to share and a couple of Sangha beers. The new location was quite busy the night we visited as our server took a bit of time to come back to us, and was also dealing with takeout orders.Food:The squash fritters were BOMB! Must get at Khao San Road - idk what their dipping sauce is made of but this lightly battered, crispy squash patty was a party of flavour in my mouth! Sweet and tangy! The khao soi had large chunks of brisket? beef and the noodles just soaked up all of that coconut creaminess. I got medium spice while my other girlfriends got mild and another went HAM with the spice level. Our server even had a quick friendly conversation with us about how she understands when food isn't spicy enough (my stomach just grumbled typing this) so she came back with bird's eye chillis for my friend!! y'all wildin!I didn't end up finishing my khao soi and neither did 2 of my girlfriends so we asked for a box to take it home. I had brought a container with me so I packed it all up for lunch the next day. I'm addicted to that sauce, let me tell you.

They have a wide variety of stuff - and even a price fixe menu which I tend to always stick with (they know what's best). I've only ever been to miku at dinner and it's always been a great experience with service - they know each dish, explain it throughly and are more than kind when serving. They really do deserve that $80-100 tip at the end!! The sushi there is always fresh and although sometimes the combo may seem weird, the chefs know what they're doing and the umami and taste just flow on the tongue. If they have wagyu ANYTHING, go for it - the best wagyu I've ever had in my whole life. It's crazy how vivid the taste is. Even the desserts are always spectacular. I love whatever they put together! The best part is that I never feel sickly full after it and although it may look small, it's a lot of food and will keep you content. Expect to drop at least $500+ on one meal though!

The sushi selection platter was extremely fresh and I love how I was able to try a little bit of everything (nigiri, roll and oshi sushi). The hokkaido scallop nigiri, amberjack nigiri and red wave roll stood out to me the most. Also the torched salmon roll literally melted in my mouth! For dessert, I got their 'Warm Matcha Valrhona Chocolate Fondant' which is basically a brownie with matcha lava inside that flows out! Since it was pretty sweet, there was the whisky ice cream on the side to help bring down the sweetness. The second dessert I got was their 'Green Tea Opera' which is a 7 layer cake (takes 3 days to make)! This cake had matcha buttercream, dark chocolate ganache, hazelnut wafer and more. I loved the fresh fruits on the side too! Overall both desserts were fantastic, 10/10! The service was excellent and I would definitely recommend if you're looking for some high end sushi! You can taste the quality difference!": "positive", "I first tried Miku in Vancouver and fell in love, when I found out that Toronto also had a location, I knew I had to try.I have to say, it's not as good as the Vancouver location, also doesn't have the views like Vancouver either.[Ebi Fritters] - These battered prawns, were an amazing appetizer with a delicious creamy sweet aioli.[Salmon Oshi Sushi] - The main reason to visit Miku. These are simple so amazing, I am usually a huge fan of dipping my sushi into soy sauce but these guys do not need any dipping. They just melt in your mouth and it's so fresh and flavourful.[Green Tea Opera] - Not picture, and I also haven't tried the one here in Toronto but the one is vancouver was amazing!Overall, the toronto location is still good, I would still recommend it, but if you're ever in Vancouver I highly highly recommend. you make a trip to MIKU YVR and reserve a seat along the window for the amazing view. Makes for a perfect date night spot or celebration": "positive", "Definitely some of the best sushi in Toronto. The food is on the pricey side, but everything is so flavourful and delicious, and the service is also excellent.We started with the spicy sesame edamame and the tempura calamari. Both were great, I especially loved the calamari which came with a delicious spiced squid ink. For sushi, we ordered all the aburi oshi, which included salmon, prawn and mackerel. The salmon has always been a favourite of mine, but all the aburi is so fresh and just melts in your mouth. Each bite is packed with so much flavour. The prawn also had a delicious zesty lime taste to it. We also tried the red wave roll, which again was so fresh and very tasty. We had a great dining experience here, will definitely be coming back!": "positive", "We had been told that this was some of the best sushi in Toronto, comparable to Nobu. Regrettably, this wasn't our experience. The resto is large, spread out over several high-ceilinged rooms and a patio. Our table was located in front of the patio, so every time that door was opened cold air blew onto us. Patrons can sit at a sushi bar during non-Covid times. Seating options include booths, banquettes and tables.I wanted to order the Miku signature sushi selection ($38), but our server advised that they couldn't leave off two allergens. That didn't make sense to me as presumably the sushi is made \u00e0 la minute, and suggested that I was being steered towards more the expensive individual options, but I went along with it. The menu is limited in scope, so I ordered a few aburi selections. The server recommended their own torching method, which I accepted. My dinner came out with an allergen on it. I was hungry at this point, so I removed the items that I could eat and let them take away the offending item. One would have thought that they would have been horrified at the mistake, and brought two pieces, or at least taken that piece off the bill; that didn't happen. My guest ordered the miku roll ($22). I've known this particular person for decades and only seen him turn down his meal once. Until tonight. He took one bite, then I could tell from the look on his face that we had trouble. Despite his nearly full plate, and my allergen issue, no one asked us how our meal was. At this point, we didn't want to complain or work on a resolution, we just wanted to get out of there.Not the experience for which we were hoping, and neither of us would return": "positive", "So happy I ordered my birthday feast from Miku in February! I picked the Sumire sushi platter with 36 pieces of torched sushi and the Hot Appetizer Bespoke Tier... I was not disappointed. The latter platter came with ebi fritter, pork katsu, chicken nanban, braised short ribs and brussel sprouts all for $50! Also ordered their Shinjuku cocktail kit. It was interesting to see the pink cotton candy dissolve into the drink. The cocktail wasn't bad but wasn't as spectacular as the entrees": "positive", "I don't know if it's because of COVID-19, but the food has gotten really salty. My friend has never been to Miku before, and after raiding about Miku to her for about a whole year, we were both left with disappointment. I was actually quite embarrassed. Oshi: saltyBrussels Sprouts: This was my first time having Brussels sprouts so this might've been my fault, but it was super bitter. I had to force myself to finish it since my mom has always taught me to not waste any food, but the Brussels sprouts really just ruined my tastebudsEpi fritters: might've been the only good part other than the dessertPickled vegetables: Aren't as sour/pickled as I'd hope it to be. Passion fruit dessert: AMAZINGService: the service and waiters here never fail to amaze me. They're super polite and friendly :)Will be back once everything has been settled, as from my past experiences, Miku still holds one of the best oshis in Toronto": "positive", "This is a review for a delivered order of Miku using Uber Eats.My friend was in town and wanted some a platter of some high end sushi on Canada Day. Not everything was open, so Miku was our only option. I'm really glad it worked out that way, because the food was amazing. We ordered the Sazanka platter and it was fantastic. The fish was fresh and flavourful, the rice was perfectly prepared and well seasoned and the vegetables included in the rolls were delicious. \u00a0It included 56 pieces of sushi and enjoyed the variety and choices offered. I would love to try eating at Miku one day": "positive", "Miku is always one of my favorite Japanese restaurant in Toronto.\u00a0 I used to dine in at least once every 1-2 months.\u00a0 It is my first time since opening back for dine in.\u00a0 Things have changed. Before entering, vaccination ID has to be check.\u00a0 When we got seated, there is no more paper menu, need to scan QR code for menu instead.\u00a0 We ordered sashimi selection, soba peperoncino, salmon oshi sushi, saba oshi sushi, miku roll, red wave roll, mochi dome and 2 matcha chocolate fondant.\u00a0 Sashimi is very fresh.\u00a0 All the other sushi and soba dish are excellent as well.\u00a0 In fact, the rolls are better than before.\u00a0 However, the portion of soba seems to be smaller size than before pandemic.\u00a0 Nothing special on the mochi dome dessert, and a hugh wow factor on the matcha chocolate fondant, so we ordered an extra one.\u00a0 Miku is still Miku from before the pandemic, the quality is still the same if not better.\u00a0 Definitely a returning dining place for me and my family": "positive", "Food was good just like &pizza it's nice toppings I came when they had their grand opening nice service then": "positive", "Pizza was great. Made quickly tasted great and lots of options. Gave one less star because the actual space could've been cleaner/neater.Also pesto garlic cheesy bread is a must try!": "positive", "Only went here once, so take this review with a grain of salt. I'll update when I come here a little bit more to see if I feel the same all throughout.Really enjoyed coming here. Have been seeing so many people go, and was quite skeptical because it is pizza, and I'm not in love with pizza like many people tend to be. The size is good enough for one person to eat. Price is $12 (tax included) \u00a0for 2 topping custom pizza. About $15 for build your own. \u00a0Crust: I love it. It's quite thin if you get the original (default) way of the crust. It's not hard or crunchy, it's just right. I thought it would be hard, meaning that it would hurt my palate, but it wasn't hard at all. It was pretty soft but had structure, and it wasn't soggy. Just right. \u00a0Sauce: You have the choice of a few different sauces that they put on your pizza at the end. Kind of over killed my pizza with BBQ sauce, but it was still good enough. In the beginning when making your pizza, you have the choice of the typical sauces (red classic sauce; alfredo; etc.). \u00a0Toppings: There isn't an insane amount of toppings. For meats there is: meat ball; italian sausage; ground beef (?); pepperoni; ham; and I think one more. Then you have your typical choices of vegetables, and I don't fairly remember if there were any fruits. I feel like there could be more toppings but it's not a huge game changer, it's good enough. \u00a0Service: It's fine. You don't really get a lot of interaction with the employees because it's not a sit in restaurant (not really; it's more like a Chipotle). But they're generally pretty nice. If you're new to the whole place, they'll give you a quick overview of how things work. \u00a0Price: Not super expensive. I would say it's pretty good for what you get. $12 (after tax) for a 2 topping pizza (custom). \u00a0Around $15? For a build your own. I think you would generally go for a build your own. There are other options like premade pizzas that you can also customize. \u00a0Conclusion: I would really enjoy coming to this place again because of the many different options that you can have and different toppings that you can put. The size of the pizza is also not too big so you can easily (at least for me) finish it by yourself.The pricing is also fair imo and it's not like you're eating cardboard. There aren't really much pizza places in Toronto that are 'fast' with their service, so I would definitely recommend going here for if you want to have pizza last minute": "positive", "This is the first time I went to Blaze Pizza. I'm pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice and attentive. The price was also reasonable. Now the pizza, it was good, nothing exceptional but good. \u00a0The topping were well served and seemed very fresh. The crust was thin and well sauced, which for me is good.All in all, a good experience and I recommend": "positive", "We love blaze Pizza and we've been customers since it's early days in Michigan. That's how we accumulated the flames - their rewards. My husband got an email that his flames are expiring. So we used them by ordering a brownie online and we went to the store to pick them up. We showed that we had an online order in our email as well as our blaze app. The lady behind the counter said it didn't show up in her system but we clearly had an order # for this exact store. Finally, she acted like she was doing us a favour and said \"this time I'll let it go\". What does that mean? We have an order number and just because of a system delay, she treated the customer so badly. Please train your staff to be courteous. Good food is important but bad customer service is what people remember for a long long time": "positive", "Busy... and service was quite slow... took about 30mins wait time.Pricing is fair... but was not impressed with the pizza... couple of cut slices had no cheese and i felt it over sauced.Knots was good for the price.I did like the finishing add on... drizzle of olive oil or flavor drizzles; pesto etc... to top off the pizzaIf you got the time to wait... its decent enough": "positive", "Not worth $14.64Average pizzaAt best Small line moving real slow One timer, prefer the couple I visited state side": "positive", "MY FAVOURITE PIZZA PLACE!! Blaze seriously never disappoints. Sometimes I'll crave it and have to bus downtown to Yonge and Dundas just to have some. I am allergic to dairy and their non-dairy cheese is the best I've had on pizza. I love that I can order any type of pizza on the menu and just ask for an adjustment in type of cheese. Other places don't offer dairy-free cheese or their options are a terrible consistency. In addition, the sauce toppings offered after the pizza is out of the oven (lemon garlic aioli, pesto aioli, bbq sauce) add a different dimension to each slice. It's also very quick to order and ready to eat. If I could eat at Blaze every day I would!": "positive", "Owned by none other than LeBron James (if you care), this place honestly is one of the best pizza joints out there... I'm personally not the type that overly enjoys Neapolitan style pizza with the soggy centre... So not a huge fan of \"gourmet\" pizza's from places like libretto and QMP But the fact that you get a pizza with unlimited toppings (literally) for something like $13, it's awesome! Although, the more toppings you out, the more stingy they get... Just beware of that...some of the best toppings include: mixing of sauces, roasted garlic, meatballs, can keep going but won't! Obviously food safety is a MASSIVE thing with this place as the cooks put toppings as customers literally peek over the sneeze guards to choose what they want...so I actually prefer that it's takeout only now and avoids customers from going over the sneeze guards and also prevents all that touching of the self-serve stuff...Reason for the 1 star deduction is because I've had a friend get a stomach ache from eating their pizza...which is obviously really bad. but who knows 100%...Personally I've always had good experiences here and never had hygiene concerns \u00a0other than those sneeze guards": "positive", "One of my go to lunch place with friends and co-workers. They offer a large variety of toppings and sauces. I also love how energetic and happy the staff are. I always get the build your own pizza and adjust the topping based on my preference that day. I highly recommend adding the fresh mozzarella, it taste amazing with almost any combination of toppings. I also like how you can get half red and half white sauce so you get to try multiple flavours on one pizza. If you enjoy heavy flavours, I like adding Caesar ,pesto and chilli flakes on the pizza after it leaves the oven. The veggie and meat selection is amazing and fresh. The final product is always baked to perfections. It has a crisp finish topped with a variety of textures and flavours of your choosing. My friend introduced this place to me and I fell in love. Since then, I have brought many other friends and co-workers to try it. Their response has always been very positive. Would highly recommend giving it a try!": "positive", "I've been so hesitant on doing an omakase experience in Toronto after my visit to Japan but I'm glad I gave it a chance. I thoroughly enjoyed celebrating my birthday at Yasu.We were the first ones to arrive so we sat on the side that seats two privately. Shared a sake pairing which worked out that we both got a shot from each bottle.Favourite piece of the night was the toro+uni. The whole experience was just around two hours. I did notice that the timing of each dish wasn't the same as other groups so there were some people that finished their experience before us": "positive", "I had been dying to try omakase for years now and finally got around to it...I had heard excellent things about Yasu and thought THIS is the place to take my omakase virginity.First impressions: small restaurant, very intimate. We sat at the bar so as to get the most out of our omakase experience. It usually is 2hrs but bc of the pandemic and trying to accommodate all reservations our time was reduced to 1.5hrs, which was still okay.One criticism I have is that it was very difficult to hear the chefs bc of the masks (obviously nothing you can do, given the situation, but considering there was a shield and barrier btwn us and them, it would have improved the experience if they had lowered their masks to explain / describe the dish...I found myself constantly saying \"sorry, what is this?\")Other than that, the food was outstanding Super fresh options from all over the world!We paid $155 each and I definitely left feeling satisfied (not over full)I'm excited to try another omakase restaurant to compare this experience to!If you are interested in trying omakase, I definitely suggest coming here but you may need to book a few weeks in advance4/5!": "positive", "We thought we were sushi snobs until we got here. Then we realized we needed some more schooling. Eating here was an excellent class. I'll say right up front that my four stars is four stars for this caliber of restaurants. It's some of the best sushi I've ever had, but the bill did shock me just a bit, comparatively. I enjoyed the experience of tasting new saki's with the saki flight, but as someone who doesn't get to drink saki that much, I wanted more and I wanted to choose. I mean, we ubered! But, you don't get that as an option. You could get glasses of wine or beers at any time though. Sitting at the bar was so much fun and we felt like we gained a family--with the chefs and with the other diners. Each couple seemed to get their own chef and ours was young and had some touches of humor. Watching the chefs was like watching Jiro dreams of sushi but like 2 feet in front of you. There was only one piece of sushi I didn't like, to quote the chef, the piece was \"inside fish.\" But, I've got a good story to tell! lol The rest was melt in your mouth little gems of joy. The mackerel (which is often my favorite) was not my favorite. It didn't have that brine I like so much, but maybe this was next level and I didn't even know it? All the rest was (like the uni and tuna rib) divine. No pictures, it was my anniversary so I kept my phone in my bag. This was a night we won't forget and even with a steep bill was well worth it": "positive", "I stopped by Yasu for a birthday celebration because I heard that this was one of the best omakase experiences in Toronto. With the lockdown finally coming to an end, it was the perfect time to check this place out. We made a reservation online for a bar seat, the restaurant only seats around 12 people per sitting at the bar and maybe 4 at a table at the back so reservations are highly recommended.The service from the waiter and the chef was attentive and it was def. a more intimate experience. The only draw back was I wasn't able to hear the chef explain the dishes he was preparing. The mask, coupled with the plastic barrier made it hard to hear. But for some reason I was able to hear the other chef explaining each dish to the couple beside me. So i'm not sure if it was my hearing, or our chef was super soft spoken.Food wise, I thought the omakase was just okay. I haven't gone to a lot of omakase's but maybe the hype got to me and I was a little disappointed. It might also be because we are still living in COVID times so the fish selection is limited with importing restrictions. The whole experience was a little underwhelming for me and some nigiri pieces were very bland tasting. Overall, it was still a nice to try experience with a personal chef preparing the meal in front of you coupled with a nice ambience": "positive", "Another wonderful experience at Yasu!! Although the price went up from the last time that I went but it's totally worth it. Fish is always so fresh and always get something new. This time the new things that I had is a tuna pate, lobster, mini sweet shrimp... I love how they allow me to have less rice I tired to keep it regular amount but I couldn't so I asked half the amount of rice half way. The dessert or the last piece is ways the same tamago. I love how they infuse the rice and the egg so it's nothing like ones u have outside . It's like cake but really eggy haha. To keep it covid preventions they have the front covered with plexiglass and depending on the party size they have dividers to divide you up": "positive", "Order their nigiri omakase for take out during Covid. Extremely reasonably priced at (13 pieces) 90$ for take out. I believe their dine in experience easily exceed 120$/person before tax and tips. The ingredients were all super fresh and be it came in a cute packaging. Their online ordering service charges service fees, I would recommend ordering directly via phone instead": "positive", "This was my first Omasake experience, and it was fantastic; I didn't want to leave. The chef and servers were very nice and attentive, and since there are only about 12 seats and two to three chefs, you can bet you'll get a lot of attention.However, I find the taste and quality to be average, but my tastebuds are weird in general; to me, everything from expensive to cheap tastes similar, but the friends I went with said the quality was outstanding. Not to say the food was bad; it was good, but not spectacular.The\u00a0\u00a0uni was delicious; it was my first time trying it, and I can now say that I am officially in love with uni.I would definitely get green tea with it, but based on what I've seen from other customers, sake appears to be a good choice as well.The ice cream/dessert at the end was absolutely delicious; I wished I had asked for another scoop": "positive", "We ordered the omakase, it was not only delicious, but also like a little taste of Japan. The fish was incredibly fresh, flavourful, and the omakase had a good variety and was very authentically Japanese. I've only had this twice outside of Japan, at Yasu and at Sushi Kaji. The omakase is great for takeout but I think I'll insist on the full experience once everything opens back up. Part of the joy of omakase is savouring the meal and interacting with the chef. With takeout, I can't be trusted not to devour the entire meal in minutes. If you want to go to Japan without going to Japan, this omakase will take you there. Add a delectable Japanese dessert (souffl\u00e9 pancakes, Hokkaido strawberry, meji chocolate almonds, or even just a green tea KitKat), and voila!": "positive", "My boyfriend and I travel to Toronto pre covid about 10x in the last 6 years.

I have a very specific one where I could eat molluscs but not crustaceans and it was so nice he could account for that. I had the pleasure of dining on the first day of reopening, which also happened to be my birthday. There were plexiglas dividers between the open kitchen and the diners. I was sat at the only dining table in the space.The omakase experience at Yasu is more of a traditional sushi \u00a0experience. Of note the following dishes caught me by surprise:Blackened cod nigiri had the texture of mushrooms and a roasted aroma. Totally fascinating and enjoyable.Eel nigiri. I usually don't care for the slimy skin of eel but this had such a tender and mild flavor, it was more like eating cooked white fish Monkfish liver nigiri. I thought it would taste like fishy foie gras but it was neither. I really gotta eat that again to figure out my feelings on it.Chutoro sashimi. To me this is the goldilocks' just-right chair of tuna. Not too fatty. The otoro nigiri was overkill for there being oil melting in my mouth but my partner loved it. The huge bisected scallop sashimi was so luscious and sweet. That was also memorable": "positive", "When the city was seeing an explosion of ramen shops open around town, it was a challenge to get a seat. But for real fans of this noodle soup dish, it's a well worth it wait to enjoy that hot steamy broth especially on a cold wintry day/night. The other places have their own unique charm, but Sansotei stands out for me. Why? Because of the noodles and the \"tonkotsu\" broth. Three types of noodles, straight, wavy, and thick sliced. Who else does that? Of course, each has their special application for what is suited to that style of noodle. So wow, I was impressed. Then, the flavour is nothing without the right broth. The combination must be just right for culinary perfection. I have dreams that rival Itami Juzo's classic movie tribute to all things ramen, \"Tampopo\" and sometimes wonder if Sansotei is my own personal \"dandelion noodle wonderland\"? Now, I'm debating whether or not to rush out the door and feed my obsession for soupy noodles. Hmm, what to do, now?": "positive", "By far my favorite Ramen in the GTA. This place was one of my first ramen shops I tried when I moved to Toronto and now it's still my favorite ramen shop in Toronto. My go to is the Black Tonkatsu Ramen. It's full of flavour and the pork is tasty. I do admit the ramen is quite salty so be prepared to be thirsty throughout the day. However, it's still very very good and the prices are fair! There is a reason why there is always a waitlist to get into the restaurant": "positive", "Excellent service and the Ramen dish recommended to me was really good. Fresh tasting and wonderful flavor of the broth and pork belly, so good": "positive", "Not a review of our experience at the restaurant, considering we never made it to being able to eat.As soon as we walked in, we were shooed back out because apparently they have to check your covid vacc outside before you even step in. Then we were made to show our IDs and our vacc proof at the same time because the girl said she had bad memory and needed to check our DOB - never had someone check that before anywhere? Then finally once we were inside, we weren't allowed to sit even though our 3rd party was parking the car and would be in 5 minutes. We left and took our business elsewhere. Understand needing precautions, but this was overboard": "positive", "This place is staffed by Japanese. I feel like I was in Japan. I tried the tonkotsu black.

The black garlic one is unreal. I have a hard time deciding what to take a bit of next. The noodles are the perfect texture.

I just moved closer to them so I can't wait to order them even more!": "positive", "If you know me at all, I am a ramen addict! So when there is one nearby that has good ratings, count me in!Sansotei Ramen was a tad bit of a jaunt from my hotel, but was worth it based on the reviews! Of course, expect the standard small ramen house, communal seating in the middle, but little to no seating outside of that. I could care less, but do not expect to stretch out here and or to have the children strolling around. Another aspect to consider is there is always a line, but they take your name and give you an estimated waiting time, so you can walk around the local neighborhood while you wait.When it comes to menu, very standard Japanese Ramen style menu, apps and ramen! I noticed a Tonkatsu Black, which peeked my interest, but it also helps many suggested it as well. Ramen was fairly quick as expected, which is great. After adding an additional egg, I was ready to go! Rating for it would fall between a 7 and a half and 8 out of 10. While I have had much better, it completely hit the spot on a cold Toronto night along with my green tea.

Would gladly revisit if I return to Toronto anytime soon": "positive", "Best ramen in downtown Toronto! The spicy tantan is constantly sold out but that's why you need to go early! We usually pair this with the gyoza (fried chicken pieces) which are juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. There's always a line up outside but it's worth the 10-15 min wait. Pro tip: there's only 2 four-seater booths, which are incredibly cozy.Pro tip 2: ask for mayo with your gyoza, it's a delicious combo": "positive", "This is our favourite ramen place in Toronto. The tonkotsu broth is amazing, with an incredible hit of umami flavour (if you're a vegetarian, this place might not be for you, though, since I believe most, if not all, of their noodle soups use this pork broth). The noodles have a perfect thick and chewy texture (there is a thick or thin noodle option, which is nice), and the shittake mushrooms (which are only included in some of the dishes, and are extra toppings in others) are great and something not often found in other ramen restaurants. As others have mentioned, the Tonkotsu Black, with the black garlic oil, is excellent, and an even bigger hit of flavour than the regular tonkotsu (be prepared! I really like the Tonkotsu Black, but I don't get it all the time because sometimes I don't feel like having such an intense flavour). The only slight downside is the meat, which can sometimes be a little bit on the dry side.The restaurant isn't very big, so be prepared to wait in line outside if you go during prime dining hours, and hope that you get a table farther away from the door in the wintertime (or be ready to wear your jacket the entire time because there will be constant gusts of wind coming in). Still worth it, though! We have been trying many other ramen restaurants in the city, and still haven't found one that beats Sansotei!": "positive", "Came here during the pandemic and it was an okay experience. The food was quite good and not too expensive. I appreciated the flavors and how quickly it was served to us. I was concerned about the waiters passing around the same plastic menus to all the tables rather than santizing them or instead using a contactless menu like most other establishments. It seemed counterproductive to all the other measures they were taking. The gyoza and soy sauce could've had a little more salt to it as I found it quite bland. Nonetheless the food was mostly good and I left happy": "positive", "Amaaaaaazing experience here.Service, food, drinks, and ambiance were all on point.Food:- Caesar - Good, tad salty from the anchovies. Nonetheless, fresh and tasty- Oysters - Kuushi... very decently-priced; about $3-4 each. Also very fresh and yummy.  - 600 day aged steak - extremely interesting steak because of the extreme aging. The texture and taste is unique, fermented meat taste (think... \"lap cheong\")- 45 day aged T-bone - nicely cooked cut of meat, very tender! - Sides: Duck fat fries, Mashed potatoes, Beef pasta thing - All of these were bombbbbbb. Absolutely recommend getting these 3. The fries and potatoes are available in half-sizes so you can get more variety heh.The steaks come with 3 different dipping salts and 3 sauces. Our favourite was the salts. Great place for a comfortable, upscale meal without the precociousness. \u00a0Price is definitely up there but definitely worth the treat :)We will absolutely be coming back for steaks!": "positive", "Came here recently for my birthday during the summer and sat on their patio as there was no indoor dining. They have a beautiful patio. \u00a0Food - Everything was great but my favourites were the Caesar salad and take home muffins. I'm pretty sure I periodically dream about their delicious salad. Steaks were good but they were slightly better pre covid and when served inside. No fault of the restaurant, just the circumstances of the environment we're all in. Needless to say the food was all still amazing. Service - Our server was great. She was personable and attentive. The food was already great but she definitely was the cherry on top of a great night at Jacobs": "positive", "Bookings open up 1 month in advance, so we were slowly slowly counting down the days until our reservation. The steak was very good - never had such a crispy sear before! Our server told us that the recommends one steak medium rare and another rare plus, however I found them both medium rare. Still good since we normally get our steaks medium rare. Unfortunately their Caesar salad is no longer made in front of you! They make it in the back and serve it to you. Definitely can't just paying $28 for that now. The potato gratin ($19) was disappointing. It was cheesy but bland? Didn't seem like they put any salt in this dish. Overall, great ambiance, service and steak, but would skip out on the other sides": "positive", "Fantastic steakhouse, best in Canada. Not only was the steak great, but the Caesar salad was very special": "positive", "The steak was perfect. I had the Filet. WOW WOW WOW. Was a bit upset with the service when I first got to the place. I was early by about 15 min. Seemed like I put them out. The food made up for it. Fantastic": "positive", "Foodie here :) Servers friendly and knowledgable, service is attentive! The bestie and I got different types of Wagyu.Cons: Ambience not quite there during covid, everyone is crammed into 1 room during dining. It gets loud! Music also very loud, not quite the calming sit down that we were hoping for. Lots of salt, and while I love salt, maybe a bit too much - hard to stomach after the salad, sides and steak were all loaded up with salt. Would love to see some milder pairing items available on the menu.Pros: the baked goods are great, if they have an in house Baker, I think they need a raise. Not too much sugar, soft and fluffy. So good. The table bread, also very good. Would have left happy with just the table bread. I swear I like steak more than I like bread, but the bread here was just better than the steak": "positive", "*pre covid review*Came here while on vacation for our anniversary in Toronto and it was a very nice meal. We came specifically because they had wagyu on the menu nut we were also excited to try their Ribeye as well.Aside from our drinks (which were delicious)we ordered:6oz Iwate prefecture wagyu and 14oz Ribeye- Both Steaks were cooked to perfection and every bite was just heavenly. Of course these were pretty pricey but they were definitely worth it. Mushroom Risotto- Honestly this risotto fell short. I am not sure if it just sat out on the plate for too long before they brought it to us but it was not hot or barely even warm. The grains were clumping together and it was not creamy like risotto should be. I also didn't really care for the flavor. A little disappointing. White Cheddar Popovers- Not bad! We like popovers and these were nice and fluffy, crispy on the outside and really tasty. At the end of the meal they brought us these delicious complimentary hand painted caramel chocolates and a muffin for each of us to have later. That worked out because we were heading to Niagara Falls in the morning and had a little snack for breakfast. Overall we really enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back the next time we are in town to see what other Wagyu options they have on the menu!": "positive", "We went to Toronto expecting poutine and my brother wanted to run into drake (him not me) on his bachelor party. I got a reservation after trying for 3 weeks. We had a fun night the night before. However this was the highlight of the Saturday night First the bread. Idk where they found the bread but I recommend it. They even give you some to go. The bread with butter was so fire. Anyone who doesn't like bread can stop reading They make the Caesar salad in front you. Dressing isn't too fishy. Lastly the meat was perfectly cooked. The sides were on point. I'd give this place an 11/10 and they have all the fancy cuts too": "positive", "Came here on a Friday night. Not too busy. The exterior of the restaurant looks like a huge storage box. Very rectangular. They have valet parking for $20. I think its pretty pricey since parking in dt toronto drops after 6pm, if you want to save some money, look for parking near the area!Once you walk in, you will see the reception. It was a bit overwhelming for me, the waitress/serves were standing in a straight line, not talking, and looking at you. Felt a bit uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy this kind of service, i just felt like there were just way too many people standing and looking at you. We were seated on the second floor. First floor is the bar area and where the pianist performed. Second floor decor was very fancy but minimal, love it. We were seated by the window. The server came by, greeted and went over the menu with us. Do not hesitate to ask them if you have any questions, they are more then welcome to assist you and give you suggestions.We ordered 2 drinks. Both very strong in alcohol flavors and less juicy or soday. Im not much of a drinker, so that was a bit too strong for me.The bread came after. Huge, fresh, crispy but soft in the side. Looks like a muffin with a huge mushroom head. Love the bread. WISH there was more. The salad came after. The caesar salad is made on the spot in front of you. I love the presentation but flavours wise, it tasted a bit too vinegar and lemony to me. Its not bad, but i had better 3/5. The steak and the sides came. We ordered the 30 days aged striploin from USA in medium. I felt like the exterior of the steak was a bit burnt, made the steak more on the chewy side. I love how they have 6 different condiments for the steak, recommend the soya sauce and the pink salt. Overall 4/5. The mushroom risotto smelt super mushroomy and cheesy. Smell and appearance is 5/5. I just wished it was more creamy, the rice was a bit on the chewy side, maybe a minute or 2 longer in the sauce can make it softer and creamer. Still not bad! 4.5/5!We ordered 2 sides, and the server recommended we do half side, which we did and super grateful because we were so full after. We had the Sauteed Rapini (the green leaves vegetable) and the potato grantin (potato sliced, and layered in cream and cheese). The rapini have some heat to it, its alright, nothing too too special 3/5. The potato was DELICIOUS, if you love cheese and cream, this is the dish for you! Super cheesy, flavourful, cripsy on the top, soft in the inside. 5/5!Last but not lease, the dessert was a chocolate pudding, whipped cream with crushed chocolate and oeros on the top and bottom. I love dessert but not a fan of desserts that are too sweet. I thought this would be way too sweet for me, but it was in a perfect balance between sweetness and chewiness. LOVE IT! Just wish there was more. 5/5.They even give you a small chocolate brownie, a cookie and 2 muffins when you ask for the bill. I was too full to even try the muffin. But overall, the experience was great. I just wish the steak was more tender and juicy and the caesar salad can be less sour or vinegary. Overall 8.5/5": "positive", "A fine dining for really good steaks, wonderful service and \u00a0exclusive ambiance. The servers are knowledgeable and well trained to ensure you have a great experience while you are there. The Sea Food Tower has a nice combination of fresh selections. The Snake River Wagyu is really great! Almost melts in mouth. It is at the higher end on price. But the ambiance and quality makes it justifiable. They also have valet parking, which definitely makes life easy": "positive", "Tasty as eggs benny . Potato's are perfect . Seems like they par boil them and stick them in the oven to crispify on the outside . Service was mad . Kept refilling our coffee till I was wired on caffeine .

Saucy and tasted delicious with the poached eggs as well. it was quite filling with the greens and home fries too. omg the home fries were delicious! they're not like home fries i've had at other brunch places. these were crispy and the sauce was . i have heard them being called \"crack potatoes\" \u00a0i would absolutely recommend this dish and have it again Sunshine Smoothie: blend of OJ, peach juice (and one more thing i forgot right now). but it was a great \u00a0accompaniment to my eggs benedict. We did reserve ahead of time and had a patio seating. it was quite busy for a monday morning, something i wasn't expecting. the patio can be disturbing sometimes especially with crowds of high schoolers/ students walking by after class. server was super attentive and refilled our hot sauce quickly, even though she was in charge of tables inside and outside": "positive", "Went for brunch on a Sunday morning and was surprised to be seated almost immediately! It's a very popular brunch restaurant in the area. We got the eggs benedict and it was delicious. The potatoes could have been cooked a little longer but flavour-wise was great as well. They're covered in Insomnia's special sauce (bbq style). Will be back again for brunch'": "positive", "Get the French Toast!! I didn't want an \"over the top\" breakfast, so instead of the Heaven on Earth, I ordered the citrus infused french toast. What a great choice! It wasn't too heavy, but the flavor was still \u00a0different than anything I've experienced. The cocktails were unique as well; the blueberry tea I ordered was a warm delight, it wasn't packed with as much flavor as I was expecting but I still enjoyed it on a cold snowy morning": "positive", "Visited Toronto for a long weekend and was recommended this place for brunch. I got a florentine benedict and it was great. We've talked about the home fries everyday since we went here they were so delicious. The servers were incredibly kind and attentive as well": "positive", "I love the atmosphere of this place, it was cozy and perfect for a date night or night out with friends. I ordered the Insomnia burger and to be honest the patty itself was way over cooked. Both sides were burnt to the point where the whole burger tasted bitter. The rest of the burger was pretty average. Some of my friends ordered the pastas and I have to say those were amazing! I would definitely recommend getting the pastas if you decide to visit!": "positive", "Many brunch spots in Toronto are just ... meh. But doing some scouting online, found this delicious spot! The wait was pretty long though, over an hour but I get why!This place definitely lived up to the hype. We got the huevos rancheros and the fried chicken and waffles. And wow both were so delicious! The fried chicken was nice and crispy and albeit the portion a bit on the smaller side. The huevos rancheros were hearty and perfectly seasoned": "positive", "Amazing service, great food, my volleyball team loved coming here after our game! $6 mimosas on Saturdays are a great choice! The Benedict's also looked really good!": "positive", "Best eggs Benedict in the city! Their service, food and atmosphere is just the best and that's why we always return back every single time does not fail to disappoint ever. Must go to brunc spots on Toronto. Their house made fries are just sooo delicious ! Can't wait to come back yet again :)": "positive", "I went to this beautiful hidden gem with my dear colleague for Lunch time. We had the prosciutto pizza. The food is amazing! I had a mochaccino and my colleague had a latte. The coffees were exquisite. The service was on point and the food came quickly without sacrificing the flavours. I am still thinking about the coffee the day after... please go to this caf\u00e9 you won't be disappointed! Both my dear colleague and I will go back for sure!": "positive", "I need to go to alpha lab multiple times for work. This is the cafe (and the only restaurant) in that alpha lab medical complex.

Latte there is \"cute\" because they made a bear for you : )": "positive", "I don't think I've been here since December 2019 so it has been quite a while, but realized I never reviewed this spot! The quality of the food here is great. It's a quaint little cafe and really nice to dine in - the ambience is incredible. It feels like you're somewhere in Europe. I remember having the pizza which was very tasty, a really good latte, blood orange sad pelligrino - such a good vibe. I look forward to coming back after covid!": "positive", "We went out of our way to go to Baretto Caffe and we were so glad we did. (We'd been shopping at CF Shops in Don Mills and its chain type restaurant options didn't appeal to us.) \u00a0Baretto's prosciutto & arugula pizza was delicious - loads of prosciutto with fresh arugula on a crispy thin crust - as was the tiny perfect tiramisu imported from the parent restaurant in Rome! \u00a0A perfect espresso to finish. \u00a0It's tricky to find but absolutely worth the effort if you're in the area. \u00a0A retail area well stocked with Italian goodies too": "positive", "The first thing that'll happen when you arrive (after a tiny struggle to find this place cus it's in the corner where the main entrance is) is that you'll be greeted by the nicest lady everrrrr! You can order at the counter for takeout or have a seat by the windows and she'll come over to take you order.We ordered the alfredo pasta and a pizza. Pizza was a thin flatbread style pizza topped with some cheapo cheese. The alfredo pasta was a good size for the price but really tasted like nothing special. Pasta wasn't homemade and the sauce was pretty average. Service over Food here!": "positive", "I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one. \u00a0The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side. \u00a0There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order. \u00a0My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates. \u00a0It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan. \u00a0My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top. \u00a0You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below. \u00a0This was perhaps the best dish of the day still. \u00a0The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna. \u00a0My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet. \u00a0Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing. \u00a0Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon": "positive", "Absolutely another one of those hidden gems! I very much recommend going if you're looking for delicious yet affordable cheap eats!I had the prosciutto bruschetta toast. Unlike the bruschetta with the diced tomato, this is more of your open sandwich idea. The bread was garlic bread! Super pleasing. The prosciutto was plentiful and the arugula was a great match.We sat in and it took little time to get our food. The server was genuinely so nice and attentive. I really recommend stopping by and enjoy a no frills eating environment": "positive", "Uh I love this place. Super tucked away in a medical office centre, it may be easy to miss.Service is IMPECCABLE, def \u00e0 5* restaurant quality. Very attentive, genuine, and happy. Two of the senior staff came to tend to my date and me, and were very glad to answer some questions about the menu.The antipasto was BLISS. Lots of prosciutto to make it worth it, veg were very fresh. I loved the tomatoes, they're so lovely they gotta be organic. The owner came to suggest drizzling olive oil over it and he was right! It was phenomenally better, which I thought was already impossible.I had the prosciutto ros\u00e9 which was good but def eons away from the antipasto.What I love is that the price point is excellent. It's my third time here and I def will return!": "positive", "This cafe is tucked away inside a medical building. \u00a0I was skeptical at first when I went in as I was thinking this is probably just another run-of-the-mill cafe that takes advantage of the fact that people are waiting for their doctors or dentists or kids who are at the doctor or dentist and just need something to eat. \u00a0Boy was I wrong.The space is elegant and clean. \u00a0Very spacious - tables are set a fairly good distance apart giving you the feel of privacy. \u00a0Decor is great and the music is a mixture of classical and, what I assume to be, European pop? \u00a0Ambience is definitely 5/5.Service was great - the servers were kind, asked if it was our first time and explained their menu. \u00a0They checked in with us at appropriate frequencies to refill water and ask us how everything was. 5/5.The food - great food for an unassuming cafe. \u00a0The lasagna was delicious and quite a large portion. \u00a0The side of greens was fresh and the garlic toast was great. \u00a05/5 for the lasagna. \u00a0The prosciutto panini was good - nice crispy bread with delicious prosciutto, slices of tomatoes and lettuce inside - basic but still done well. \u00a0A little sad that it doesn't come with anything on the side but oh well - 4/5.Value - I think this is what brings this place really up. \u00a0The lasagna was about $10.50, the panini $7.7 (before tax + tip). \u00a0The lasagna is totally worth it at that price point - really should have just gotten two of those.Overall, quite a hidden spacious cafe that serves delicious food at reasonable prices": "positive", "My favourite coffee shop to get work done in this neck of the woods.

I personally love their mushroom pasta, as we come exclusively for that alone some times (it also travels well so the take-out version is great). Other great dishes include the Kale salad (basic but boogie) and beef tartare. They also have in-house wine (red and white) that you can pour by the oz, which lets you either go easy for the night or a hard as you want. An elevated classic Italian restaurant is what I would call Gusto. I would highly recommend!": "positive", "You cannot PASS-ta the opportunity to go to Gusto 101 - it is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in downtown!Malfade Ai Funghi (9.5/10) $24 - This is their most popular dish and for good reason.

The mushrooms are so fragrant and the creamy truffle sauce is to DIE for \u00a0This is a MUST HAVE if you come to Gusto!!!!! + its vegetarian Calamarata (8.5/10) $22 - Like the name, the pasta is shaped like Calamari! If you like seafood \u00a0you will be a huge fan of this pasta.

Quality: food was good. \u00a0A bit of a mixed feeling here though. \u00a0I love al dente but Mafalde Ai Funghi were way too under, by a good min or two. \u00a0The truffle sauce was also too heavy. \u00a0The Bolognese was fantastic as was the simple lemon spaghetti. \u00a0The pizza's here are some of the best in the city. \u00a0The Huge issue (hence the 3 stars) was service and quality of the calamari. \u00a0On the former, the staff was not very attentive, and a bit aloof. \u00a0The latter was just flat out bad. \u00a0Either the calamari were frozen and/or were not washed properly as it had bad smell and immediate fishy taste. \u00a0Gusto can probably do better": "positive", "Didn't know i could've made reservations for NYE but was really lucky i got to end the year here!": "positive", "I had been wanting to come here to celebrate special occasions since 2014 but somehow just missed the opportunity and every time ended up dining at chain restaurants. Fast forward to 2021 while visiting Downtown Toronto, I finally went to Gusto 101 for a date night with my husband. It was not very crowded on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately, as socially distanced as possible from other tables. The inside of the restaurant has a nice, romantic and rustic charm with tea lights at each table - nice for a date night but not spaced out if you're looking for privacy. The tables are quite close and you could easily hear the conversations at the next table. But that's the case with many restaurants downtown that have an intimate setting. We did not get to see their rooftop patio since it was closed for winter. For appetizers we shared an order of the arancini which was good but on the sweet side due to the saffron risotto in it. For mains I ordered their popular mushroom pasta, it was really delicious and worth the hype. My husband got the Margherita pizza - the crust was thin and quite soggy towards the middle of the pizza almost like a wrap! I really liked the sauce on the pizza though. For dessert we got the tiramisu. Every dish had extremely small portion sizes. Also our waiter took very long to come to our table to take orders for food, drinks and also to bring the bill. We were not in a rush but felt a little ignored, because other tables in close vicinity got better attention. I noticed this as there was no eye contact made when it really came to a point I had to waive at him to get his attention. But overall a great experience. I will definitely return in the summer to try their drinks and the kale salad next time": "positive", "For me, this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. The food is amazing and fairly priced. We went around 5:30 on a Thursday and got seated immediately (the website said they don't take reservations so we just walked in). We were seated on the upstairs patio and there was a lot of room, probably due to COVID restrictions as well. For our app, we ordered the calamari fritti. It was amazing and the lemon aioli was delicious. We ate it so fast I forgot to grab a picture of it. For our mains, we ordered the famous truffle mushroom pasta and the Diavola pizza. The mushroom pasta was creamy, cooked perfectly and they did not skimp out on the truffle. \u00a0Although the portion may not look like a lot, it is really filling. The pizza was great as well but the pasta was definitely the star dish. The staff is really nice and service was fast. There are plenty of staff cleaning as well so it felt very COVID safe.

Quite frankly, I don't eat enough oysters to know which is which. But I can tell the oysters were very fresh, clean, and they tasted delicious. I should have paired them with some white wine.However, having only cold seafood as dinner was probably not the best idea during winter. Yes, you should order the seafood tower, but also order 1-2 appetizers or 1 main to pair with. I highly recommend taking advantage of their daily specials - you will not regret it.

So some savings is great. They do have a service charge of 18% that is added to the bill already just fyi. The burger is hot, delicious, juicy and something you don't expect to order for an oyster place... But trust, it's a must order. I got the fish and chips. Decent fish and the tartare sauce is divine. The one drawback were the fries. They were very overdone - either old and refried or just left in the oil too long? It didn't look bad. They were thin cut but not sure why it was hard and wasn't the same as previous orders from this place. Our server replaced it and it was better than the ones that came with our dish, but was still a bit overdone. Tbh I think the oil might have been too hot or something was amiss with it. In either case, the service was great and they definitely accommodated us as best as they could. We appreciate it!Currently they have patio dining outside on the parking lot.

My partner was easily convinced into order their signature burger, easy compromise.The food was delicious and well packaged, but for the price, I had to knock off one star. The lobster roll was everything I dreamed of, but for $25 I really expected more than a 4 inch roll with maybe a quarter cup of lobster. The whole thing took me all of 3 bites to eat, in less than 2 minutes. Tasty, but such a disappointment. Many mixed emotions here. On top of that, you have to order a side, but the price of the side is not included in the combo so I had to pay an extra $5 for fries, which was...not great. I'm glad they forced me to order the fries though, because they ended up being the main part of my meal since my lobster roll disappeared in 2 minutes. I was hungry after, and very jealous of my partner's burger, which he enjoyed and was a generous portion (also required to pay extra for a side).I cannot give 5 stars based on how disappointed I was, but I will also not leave a bad review because I believe the in-person dining experience will be much different. I look forward to visiting in person and trying their other menu items and updating my review accordingly": "positive", "If you check in on yelp, most likely will get 10% off.

We started with they're ever delicious oysters (6) just as an app, and very fresh sweet oysters. I ordered the trout with a Korean style flair? It had kimchi styled rice, fried egg, and broccolini. My wife ordered the mackerel appetizer (whole fish btw). My guests order the scallop dish and a clam chowderEverything ate really well, fish was cooked beautifully. Whole mackerel was a surprise and very tasty. My guests from Australia enjoy the clam chowder and the scallops looked delicious. There isn't a ton to say about this place in re: to the food. Good seafood kinda of speaks for itself, and the restaurant does a great job producing great food": "positive", "Wvrst is A must try staple in the King St area. \u00a0The hand made pretzel was soft and chewy. \u00a0The mustard had an underlying horseradish taste so it was a bit spicy. \u00a0Duck fat fries are greasy but very delicious -- the dipping sauce was heavenly. \u00a0We got the bison sausage and duck sausage. \u00a0I was surprised that neither were gamey at all. \u00a0You can taste the excellent quality of the meats. \u00a0There are other more exotic options such as kangaroo and vegetarian options too. \u00a0A lot of produce and product are locally sourced. \u00a0There is an outdoor patio and indoor seating as well": "positive", "We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and were seated right away. The staff was extremely friendly and nice, and offered us their advice on drinks and foods! It was our first time trying this spot and we were excited for the cuisine they offer. I ordered the house pretzel (served with hot as ever wasabi mustard) and an extra side dip of boiling hot Gouda cheese (delicious!!). The pretzel was a bit on the dry side, but the cheese dip made it much better. We ordered their signature potato salad, and that was absolutely delicious. Super creamy and packed with flavour! My boyfriend had their burger (the only one they offer), and I had a bite (for the sake of this review). It was great! Juicy and flavourful and cooked just about right. It was on the smaller side though so if you're a big guy you might need some sides. The duck fat fries side was disappointing. They were hard, and almost over cooked with barely any flavour. Again, the truffle mushroom mayonnaise dip we ordered made them better. The green garden salad was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall it was a good experience and the location and their patio seating is really nice. I think if you decide to go there it would be best for you to try their signature sausages. That would be definitely something I would try next time since I didn't have much luck with my pretzel": "positive", "Their duck fat fries are AMAZING!! The sauce that comes with the fries are completely game-changing. Super creamy and savory. I also ordered their Danger Dog, which was filled with the most deliciously melted cheese. Service was also very attentive. They came to check up often to see how I was doing": "positive", "Wow what an interesting dining experience. They have an abundance of interesting and exotic meats from elk to rabbit to kangaroo. If you're feeling adventurous with food this would be a great place to go. I ordered the rabbit dog and the meat was seasoned with tomatoes and other seasonings. The texture is not like the usual hot dog it was definitely more meaty and rough. You can choose two toppings so I chose the jalape\u00f1os and saut\u00e9ed onions. Overall a great dog but I wouldn't order again something worth trying at least once though": "positive", "Note: visit took place pre-COVID.They don't have table service so you whip out a menu at the front and grab a seat wherever (except for the reserved areas) then when you're ready, order at the front and get a number to await your delicious goods. Seating is cafeteria style so get ready to have people close by. It can be pretty loud but the ambience is nice. There's an open concept kitchen and little fairy lights adorning the place. I didn't order any beer but I noticed they also have a good beer selection.The food can take long to arrive if it's really busy. 1 friend got her vegetarian Mediterranean sausage bun 15 mins in but my other friend and I waited over 30 mins for our duck fat fries and sausage buns. I ordered another sausage bun to go to bring home to my partner but they made the mistake to bring all our food at the same time and packed our entire order to go. This was a little upsetting and there wasn't really anything to do about the situation, but it did dampen the experience a bit. The duck fat fries are a little dry for my liking but the flavour is good. The included jalape\u00f1os still have seeds in them so it has a KICK. The standout though was definitely the currywvrust sausage mmmm. Definitely needs more sauce though. I got a kangaroo bun with saukeraut and onions.I'd say the food was fine but I wasn't wowed or anything. I do think the place is worth giving a try for the ambience alone. Cool place to chill after work. :)": "positive", "Lively little joint with good vibes, great beer, and impeccable service. However I just don't think the sausages were flavorful enough, especially the elk sausage had some really chewy sinewy parts. Duck fat fries were a little thicker than your usual fries and a bit greasy, but delicious with the paired chipotle mayo. Overall a good visit but I'm not rushing to return": "positive", "Not the wvrst place for late night comfort food But seriously this place is awesome for friends after a night out on king west or for after work drinks. Seats a lot of people communal style. Can't really go wrong with any of their sausage options or curry wurst": "positive", "There're more types of sausages here than you can shake a stick at. In the category of game alone you get exotic choices like venison, bison, wild boar, rabbit, kangaroo, elk & guinea hen.I went for Wild Boar. The tea gave it an unusual flavour that worked (if you're up to try wild boar, you probably don't mind tea in your sausage anyway). It wasn't too gamey either. It came with a bun which was a toasted mini baguette, not your normal hot dog bun.I chose to have it with sauerkraut and onion. The sauerkraut was basically boiled cabbage & didn't taste of much. Onion tasted very mild. The bland topping were probably so as not to mask the taste of the sausage.Duck fat fries were fantastic. The animal fat gave them a superior flavour & it was a big portion too.\u00a0They were thick cut & crispy enough (like British chips, but the bite from the duck fat means they were more satisfying than their crispiness would warrant). I chose garlic chive sauce as my dip, which was delicious": "positive", "Cheese Fondue, Bratwurst, Beer. Do I need to say more? Ontop of that, the atmosphere is very rustic and has a tavern feel to it. I love German food, and this was an exceptional German cuisine experience": "positive", "At first the menu was very overwhelming but the workers were helpful and answered all of our questions. The restaurant was clean and spacious. We went on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't too busy and the food came out quickly.For food I tried the Tamworth & Wild Boar sausages. Tamworth was described as spicy but I didn't find it that spicy. It was okay, I wouldn't get it again. I loved the wild boar, it was perfect in currywrvst style. I also really liked the jalape\u00f1o and cheddar pretzel, it had a nice texture and a fluffy inside.We tried the beer flight, I thought it was a good deal. It is \u00a0$14 and you get 6 beers (5oz. each) so 30oz. total! You don't get to choose the beers but we enjoyed most of the beers. We liked 4/6": "positive", "Traveled to Toronto for NYE and I found Mildred's online as a must try spot for brunch! We had an hour and 25 minute wait but everything after was amazing 1. The ambiance was nice and the bathrooms were super cute & clean 2. Our server Scott \u00a0was great - he was attentive and also ensured we were aware of the daily omelette & overall just on top of it!3. My Vanilla Latte with a shot of baileys= superb 4. My omelette was amazing such a great jobI would have given this place 5 stars but the wait def was long but overall this is a must try and in liberty village in a cute shopping area!": "positive", "10/10. Show stopping. Out of this world. For real though Mildred's was a great experience!!!The wait time is usually quite long. I arrived at 11 and there was a 1.5 hour wait. However they had seating at the kitchen view which had no wait so I jumped at that! Ordered the eggs Benny and pancakes to share. Food came quite prompt. The eggs Benny with smoked salmon was good - it came in a croissant - but wow the pancakes...these pancakes were incredible. I have not tried pancakes like this ANYWHERE. The blueberry compote with the fresh cream. Mmmmm so good!!!! If there was a wait longer than an hour I'm not sure if I would have stayed, but I'm glad I got to try out Mildred's - it truly was delicious!": "positive", "5 star food1 star service first time here after reading the raving reviews - and for the most part, they were true. the blueberry pancakes were phenomenal, which is an understatement. the texture of the pancakes were heavenly, and the berry compote was spot on. i also thoroughly enjoyed the steak and egg special, which came with a barbecue sauce i could drink straight out of a tub. sooo delicious. the eggs were perfectly cooked and complimented the steak well. although the food was incredible, the service, however, was not. we were in there for almost 2 hours, albeit it was busy, but there's no justification for having to wait 2 hours after being seated. this also snowballed me into being late for work. the worst part is, the kitchen being open, we could see our food ready for us, and it was just sitting there, getting cold. the food was lukewarm when it got to the table, but we were so hungry at that point that we let the temperature slide. our waitress was nowhere to be seen for long periods of time, where we had to find and flag her down for water. i wish i could come here again, but after such a conflicting experience (great food, bad service), i will order takeout instead": "positive", "finally tried this brunch spot! i came during the week and it was surprisingly busy! we wait for around 15-20 minutes, even though they said it'll approximately be around 40 minutes. either way i would've waited!! i got the wally cheesy savoury tart and omg \u00a0soooooooo good!! it was pretty filling even though it may not look like it.def coming back!!": "positive", "2.5/5Soooo disappointed with our experience here - I had such high hopes! Everyone raves about this place (esp the pancakes!)Cons: Famous Pancakes: It pains me to say this but what ruined the meal was the pancakes. These were SOOOO DENSE. Like fluffy? Not an adjective for these pancakes. Reminded me of Bisquik-powder pancakes. Incredibly disappointing after hearing all the amazing reviews. In hindsight, we should have absolutely sent these back to be re-made. Pros:Scones & Biscuits: 5/5 EXCELLENT!!! Came with softened butter and an apple jam/puree. My favourite were def the scones - they're served fresh, warm, buttery, delishhh. Biscuits were nice as well. Service: GREAT! Our server was really nice and checked up on us. Average/Decent/Aiiiight:Veda's Choice: Smoked salmon benny on a croissant - the egg was very nicely poached. It was decent.Drinks: Also just decent.I'll give Mildred's another chance to redeem their pancakes in the future as I'm going to assume this was a one off event": "positive", "Top three restaurants for me in the city. Worth the wait every time!Their burger is one of the best I've ever had, and that blueberry pancake is heavenly!Do yourself a favor and go there": "positive", "Going to keep this review short and sweet (like blueberry compote and syrup sweet). This place is deeeeelicious. All other positive reviews are bang on. This place has a great atmosphere, trendy, great wait staff who are quick to serve, and their food....droooool. If you go, a must try is their pancakes. They are a tall stack order so they do sell them by singles or you can share a plate if you go with others. Fries always come with a side of garlic aioli. Very garlicy but so yummy. The only downside to this place is the long wait times. Go very early on weekends because the wait is typically 1.5-2 hours. We waited 3hrs on a busy Sunday - totally worth it. Try a weekday if you can to avoid major wait times. They also take your phone number so you can go shopping while you wait. Overall no negatives. A great place to try out and a must for brunch": "positive", "it's been a while since i updated my review.when i first came here i wasn't living in liberty, but now i have the convenience of putting my name down and walking home - also the pandemic and making reservations when it first opened up again was amazing.this still is one my of top 3 places in toronto to go for brunch, even ordering during the pandemic wasn't a hassle - i loved that there was the pop up schoooples too.It was nice to be back here and as always the quality of the food and the service is always great!I chose the salmon benny this time and it didn't disappoint!If you haven't had the pancakes, they're a taste of freshness - must try even if it's only 1!": "positive", "Great brunch option for patio season, located in the heart of Liberty Village!! Friendly customer service and the food lives up to the hype. Pancakes were soft & flavourful. Wait times were reasonable if you arrive early before noon, with many shops in the surrounding area you can visit as you wait for your table to be ready. They don't takes resos so definitely keep that in mind!": "positive", "Best, fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. Tried to recreate them at home during lockdown but was nothing like the real deal. The blueberry and whipped cream topping go so well with it too. Friendly staff. Really nice ambience. Worth the 2 hour wait!": "positive", "Jabistro never fails to disappoint. On this visit we ordered the wagyu carpaccio, sashimi platter. Aburicious (selection of pressed, torched sushi), salmon oshizushi and miso soup. You must try the sashimi and torched sushi when you visit. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and the torched sushi has amazing flavour. From the aburicious platter, our favourite was the salmon. I'd skip the wagyu carpaccio next time, as the pieces were cut a little thick for my liking.Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for some quality sushi": "positive", "Everything was fresh and the taste is 10/10! However, we were disappointed there were no lobster sashimi when we were there, which was the reason why we went there in the first place. 3 ppl We ordered: Miso soup Uni x6 (very good!)Sashimi tray 9 Pc nigiri Pressed sushi (not sure why I order it every time I go, but not a fan) Fried chicken Black miso cod Sake 3ml After all that, I was still hungry, so I ordered another 7 pc nigiri. Total bill came out to be $409.... Another thing that was disappointing is that portion of the sashimi tray were tiny. It was half the portion of what it used to be. The food was great! But the sashimi portion was disappointing": "positive", "I was so excited to eat here but my experience didn't turn out the way I hoped The service was excellent and the decor/atmosphere was cute but the quality of the food could use a big improvement. My favourite thing that I ordered was the torched salmon (rich and flavourful) followed by the chef's sushi choice (nothing special here). The hoikkado salad was really fishy for my liking and I didn't like the miso cod. I got a green tea mojito and I didn't like that also.In general, the price was high for average sushi": "positive", "HANDS DOWN BEST JAPANESE I have had in Toronto!! One word to describe everything - FRESH. Everything is just so insanely fresh, beautifully plated and beautifully cut. Service is fantastic and i just have zero complaints. \u00a0You need to come here and try!": "positive", "One of the better above average quality sushi joints without the steep omakase price tag.Came here for dine in after the implementation of proof of vaccination requirement. Server checks for documentation upon arrival of the venue.Tables were nicely spaced apart, and the venue was clean.If you're looking for value and quality, this is not the place you should be going. If you're looking for decent quality sushi without the price tag of an omakase meal, you've found the right spot. This is amazing venue for date and girls night out meal.This time we ordered their sashimi platter (20 pieces) and jabristo roll to share. Jabrstio roll is one of my favourite rolls at the menu! I always order this when I am there": "positive", "Everything about this dining experience was amazing. The service was quick and attentive; the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere was perfect. To start, we got the deep fried lobster. It was some of the best deep fried lobster I've had. The portions looked small but it was more than enough and was super filling. The pairing sauces were also great and elevated the lobster. For our mains we got an order of the salmon aburi and the ebi aburi. The salmon aburi was the best I've tried. The flavours were amazing and the rice was so soft. The ebi aburi was also great but it wasn't the best in the city to me, it is still worth a try. The food was actually so good we ended up ordering the aburi platter without the Saba. The jabistro roll was good too but the aburi definitely the thing to try here. We were also given a free matcha lava cake since we were celebrating a birthday. It was so good and soft. If you like matcha, you will love this cake. It was a nice touch by the staff. I will definitely be going back and would recommend this place to anyone": "positive", "Delicious and friendly service! Came here for my birthday, love their torch pressed sushi. Recommend and will go back again": "positive", "This is the first time I'm giving JaBistro anything lower than a 4 star. I'm giving them a 3.8 star for this dish. Currently JaBistro is running a promotion for 3 special dons. One is maguro, one is salmon and uni and the last is wagyu and uni. All around $30-50. I ordered the maguro don, but I asked them to add uni on top which I paid $10 for. But then they ended up putting it in some soy sauce container and it ended up looking so scuffed as you can see after I added it on the don myself. In the past week, I've had dons fromother places such as Omai and Shunoko and JaBistro considering how expensive and what they're known for is kind of a let down. Rice is not as seasoned, other places season the rice really well and add furikake. Fish was just normal, it was still decent but definitely not worth the price. Quite unlucky": "positive", "It's not really worth it.The quality of the fish was good but I found the taste to be a little too foreign.The fried lobster calamari was good but the portions are too small.I know at higher end restaurants this is usually the standard however, I found even with this it tasted a little bit over cooked.This location had a a nice outdoor wooden patio on the rooftop which was nice.Customer service was ok no complaints there.I definitely wouldn't go back- nothing special and we were not full": "positive", "I was missing going here in person because the experience was so mind blowing. The service was so friendly and knowledgable and the food was fantastic.We tried getting takeout from here and it was very delicious and presented very beautifully. However it's just not the same as going in. Even that little bit of time driving it from the restaurant to us made the torch sushi lose that tiny bit of warmth that has when it arrives fresh to your table. This is no fault of the restaurants of course. This is just Covid. I love that they had a Bento special going on. It seems like they're having lots of specials happening here and there. So make sure to check those out. It was still a really lovely treat.I can't wait to go back in person!": "positive", "Stopped by for a snack and my one regret is not being hungry enough to try the soup dumplings. Luckily I got to try the pan fried dumplings and they were phenomenal. Lots of places make these and ends up drying out the soup but there was plenty in these! The crisp on the bottom was perfect and the dough was light and airy. Delicious filling as well - loved this place. FYI - only take out at the moment!": "positive", "For the price, you probably cannot beat this spot. For what you're paying, the portion size is decent and extremely filling. This place was recommended to us by almost everyone who lived in Toronto. Service is quite fast too, despite a filled storefront. We got the scallion pancakes, wontons in chili oil, xiaolongbao, and Shanghainese pan fried dumplings. I do think they were very delicious, but not as \"authentic\" in the details. Flavor and everything they nailed, but it was the small things that I had more expectation for: - Chili oil in wonton: the chili oil part was a bit lacking in flavor in my opinion, though they nailed the sweetness of this dish - Panfried dumplings: my friend is from Shanghai, and mentioned that he wished the bottom of the bun was more panfried - it almost seemed just like any other steamed bun (though flavor was amazing!) - Scallion pancake: missing just a bit of the crunchy texture Overall though, would definitely be a place to come back to for how good it tastes and the reasonable pricing!": "positive", "I am Taiwanese and xlb are in my top 5 favorite foods of all time. As a result, I've tried A LOT of soup dumplings. These ones....I thought were okay. I came 30min before closing and I had to take my order to go (Juicy dumpling is not doing dine-in right now). This is a disservice to xlb because they are definitely best enjoyed hot and fresh. I will start by saying that the flavor is really good. The pork inside is perfectly steamed and the broth was delicious. The dumpling skin has the perfect thickness - not too much dough but not so thin that the skin will break when being picked up. However, it is possible the xlb did not break because there was barely any soup inside. If you are like me and like to pour out the soup onto a spoon...you're going to have a difficult time getting enough soup out. I also ordered some pan fried items. I don't know if they were affected the steam inside the takeout box, but my pan fried dumplings were not crispy. They were just squishy and oily. The flavor was still good though. A final nail in the coffin: \u00a0no vinegar or ginger. There wasn't even soy sauce. (I asked) My order came with two packets of manufactured hot chili sauce which was just a tragedy to dip soup dumplings in :(I can't complain too much because the dumplings are pretty cheap (for western standards). It is also possible that the dumplings were less fresh right before closing time. I'm honestly shocked that there are so many fantastic reviews. Are Yelpers rating this place based on the quality or the value? The latter is great but the former is...questionable. I will have to come back during the middle of the day to see if my experience improves": "positive", "Had the chance to try Juicy Dumpling - and this place was soooo delicious! This is a small little joint near the Kensington Market Area, I think near the Chinatown section, and my cousin spoke highly of it. I am a huge fan of the steamed pork dumplings, especially when it comes with soup - and these absolutely hit the spot. For $3.99 a pop this came with 6 dumplings - so juicy and absolutely DELICIOUS! I was blown away how tasty this dish was - and would highly recommend others to try it!": "positive", "These dumplings are delicious, and are what you need on a cold day in Toronto! They are so flavourful and are always served hot and fresh. My only problem is that they increased the price from 2.99 to 3.99. I personally feel like the price increase wasn't necessary. They were perfectly priced before and served as a nice cheap treat. The other concern I have is that there isn't anywhere to sit/stand and enjoy the food. They used to have a stand up bar that people would quickly eat at in the past, but there was caution tape on it. It's difficult to take the soup dumplings and go somewhere else to eat because they get cold and don't taste as good after": "positive", "Pan fried juicy pork buns. Nuff said. Actually, no, there's much more. The dumplings here are amazing. Dumplings are a big deal. All dumplings are not created equal. There are many factors to the perfect dumpling. I know little about these things. What I do know is that I was blown away by their pan fried juicy pork bun. The best I've ever had. When you dedicate your menu to a single category like dumplings, you have a lot to prove. Juicy dumplings are all that. MmmmmMmmmm": "positive", "My husband and I loved their veggie and soup dumplings. My meat eating husband loved the bursting soup dumplings in his mouth. He was excited like a child every time he had one of the dumplings. The price is unbeatable - $2.69 for 6 filling dumplings is a steal. My veggie spinach and mushroom bao buns were pretty great too. I ordered the shitake mushroom bao and was slightly disappointed that it hardly had mushroom and it was mostly spinach. But the bao buns were pretty huge, filling and tasty. I wish they had the hot oil and if they had that, I'd even buy it for an extra dollar. That would make it a killer meal. I can't wait to get them again and have with some store bought hot oil": "positive", "Got P1 - pan fried mini soup dumplings. They were pretty good, but really they were just pan fried versions of steamed mini soup dumplings. While the skin was thin enough & they were juicy & tasty, what worked for steamed dumplings didn't quite work for pan fried ones: though only cursorily panfried, the skin on some broke & the juices inside leaked out. Just go for the normal dumplings - they're almost certainly better & $1 cheaper too (making them a real steal).If you're in the mood for something fried, go for pan fried juicy buns, since those are meant to be fried.They also have some other odds & ends, e.g. sesame seed balls (with red bean inside)": "positive", "I have been hearing about this place for so long and been wanting to try it for so long. I have always been a huge fan of xlb (xiao long bao steamed pork dumplings).Finally got a chance to stop by the neighborhood today. Ordered two S1 ($2.99 for 6 pork dumplings). There was lots of people there but my order was ready within 5 mins.It's juicy and it's good. The price is affordable. No wonder it's like a neighborhood gem. Will definitely come back for more ": "positive", "Delicious dumplings! \"S2\" is my favourite. Flavoursome, juicy (as the name suggests), generous serving. A must try when in Toronto for sure. I went here once a few years back, and remembered how good the dumplings were so when in Toronto again this week I popped back in and was not disappointed!": "positive", "A perfect evening with near perfection service and accompanying dishes. A must go-to restaurant.The venue is beautiful In the winter and I'd imagine even more beautiful in the summer. We were quickly seated to our table and our waiter provided the best service I've ever had. His attention to detail was impeccable. And it sets the mood for an enjoyable evening.As for the food, you can't go wrong. It's a dynamic menu that changes and is focused so I'm sure picking any dish will be good. Both of our entrees which were duck and bison was cooked to perfection as you can see from the pictures. And the desert was quickly cleaned as soon as it arrived.This is definitely in my top 10 of restaurants to go to globally": "positive", "The low rating is for how non-inclusive they are with children and their poor customer service. I understand that children may not be Scaramouche's target audience but in the inclusive world that we live in, you made the conscious decision not to equip your restaurant with any high chairs or boosters for young diners? Good luck with your archaic business model.When we made the reservation and on the day of confirmation we confirmed that we are coming with a baby. They failed to inform us that there is no equipment to support young diners. If I knew I would have gladly brought my own high chair. Once we arrived they denied knowing that we were bringing a baby. No apology nor any sincere check in to see how we are doing. It's such a shame because the food was great but our dinner was so hectic scarfing down food to restrain an active toddler. Even after I shared my feedback with them via email, I received a non-genuine response nowhere mentioning that they will look to improve on this, no accountability or ownership for their mistake. They made us feel that our dining experience nor our feedback was important. Truly disappointing, we will never return due to the horrible treatment we received": "positive", "I was really excited to try this place after so many years. I was a bit let down. Based on the reviews, I feel like this restaurant used to be really great in the past and now not so much. I'm not sure if it's because the quality has gone down or other restaurants in general have really upped their game. But I will say that their mashed potatoes and their scallop dish was delicious. Everything else was underwhelming. The staff was really nice": "positive", "Old fashioned and charming as always. Great food and service everytime": "positive", "Update review - visited this restaurant again 2 years after my first visit. They never disappoint me! My husband and I had Tuna tartare & foie gras terrine for appetizer. I'm not a big fan of foie gras but their foie gras changed my mind. It was amazing. For main, we had scallop and duck. Scallop was nicely seared and very juicy. Duck was very tender and nicely flavored. Dessert (chocolate ganache) was a bit disappointing to be honest. We took away Coconut cream pie to make up for it.. lol. Scaramouche is still my most favorite restaurant in Toronto !": "positive", "In the decades that I've been going to this beautiful place I have never had a bad meal. Whether I've been in the pasta bar or the more formal dining room everything is reliable and delicious": "positive", "In the dynamic culinary world in Toronto, where so many restaurants open and close their doors, Scaramouche Restaurant is an institution that has graciously withstood the test of time.Nestled in a quiet residential street in leafy South Hill, the restaurant enjoys a privileged view of the downtown core; while not as dramatic as the views from the 54th floor of TD Tower, the view is still a lovely backdrop to exquisite meals.Upon arrival, complimentary valet parking is available for patrons. A set of stairs leads us down to the dining room, with a subdued but pleasant elegant decor. In the time of coronavirus, Stage 3, protocols are in place to ensure the safety of guests.For amuse bouche, we were offered a lovely refreshing tomato gazpacho, rich in wholesome flavors. It reminded me of an appetizer I enjoyed many years ago at Scaramouche; it was a corn soup, but while you might think \"corn soup at a fine dining restaurant?\", let me assure you that the kitchen had taken such a seemingly pedestrian dish and elevated it to heights that I was not expecting.I started my meal with an appetizer serving of the Gnocchi Parisienne (seasonal mushrooms, thyme, garlic, summer greens, truffled mushroom reduction, crispy Parmesan wafer). I love a well prepared gnocchi, and Scaramouche did not disappoint. The gnocchi was rich and buttery, the chanterelles were a perfect pairing for the truffled mushroom reduction, which was to die for.For my main I opted for the classic Grilled Filet Mignon (Ontario AAA beef, sauteed mushrooms, French green beans, crispy pressed potatoes with parsley, garlic and lemon, Bordelaise sauce). The dish was competently executed, the filet mignon was perfectly cooked, and the pressed potatoes were very nice in terms of texture and flavor. The only issue is that it was noticeable that the dish sat for too long under the heat lamp, and by the time it was served, it was overall lukewarm, instead of having been served hot.I finished the meal with a Scaramouche classic, its famous Coconut Cream Pie (coconut custard, Chantilly cream, white chocolate shavings, dark chocolate sauce). The custard is filled with coconut, topped with a light Chantilly cream; the white chocolate shavings add a creamy richness to the dessert, while the dark sauce enhances it with a chocolate punch. Service is professional and attentive. Our server, Andrew, has been with Scaramouche for many years and makes sure that patrons needs are taken care of. Regular and vegetarian menus are available. Please be advised that bread is a separate charge, which in my personal opinion is poor form for fine dining establishments.TLDR; great food, great service, nice ambiance, recommendedthomassu.smugmug.com/Foo\u2026": "positive", "I was so excited to try this hi is place as I saw so many great reviews! The restaurant is very hard to find in fact it's located inside an apartment complex and there are no signs at the front so we definitely got lost at first. They have a complementary valet which is nice. Inside the restaurant looks pretty basic kind of reminded me of the keg or other older restaurants. The place was a little busy but definitely not full. I thought the service was excellent and our server not only knew the menu but was able to recommend some wines to go with our food. The food itself was pretty good. I had gnocchi maybe it was my fault ordering them. I definitely had better gnocchi before but they were still pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try something else": "positive", "Review disclaimer: knew somebody who works here so definitely got the VIP treatment. Got to meet a couple of the owners and toured the kitchen as well.Made reservations for The Restaurant for a better view. Seated by the window, right beside the downtown skyline, which looked amazing at night. The server was very kind and knowledgeable. Asked for some drink recommendations and the server recommended something that was not on the menu. As the entrees were shared, the server suggested serving them already split for the table. That was a nice touch.Presentation of each dish was clean and everything tasted absolutely amazing. Roasted duck breast paired with pan seared foie gras and duck broth was heavenly. This must be one of the best dishes; this was the dish the chef chose compliments of the house. The crispy pressed potatoes with the filet mignon, simplicity at its best. Not a huge fan of coconut but the coconut cream pie was light and not overly sweet.Overall, if the wallet can afford it will definitely be back !! When the chef is also an owner, they seriously are serious about food": "positive", "Excellent service great atmosphere, food was delicious recommend going on a weekday get better seatings": "positive", "This was one of the best things I ate in Toronto. Came in for dinner. The place was packed. This spot deff gets busy in the evenings.I went with the Traditional . It's Fried chicken unlike any you've ever tasted. Tender and juicy breast that's deep fried, chopped up and served with sauce and rice. \u00a0The traditional is kinda curryish, with a nice coconut flavor.Crab meat balls - a mix of crab and mashed potatoes. With tartar sauce. These were insanely delicious.Fried shrimp - delicious, long shrimp that's deep fried and served with tartar sauce. Also incredible.Service was fantastic!": "positive", "I had a sudden craving for authentic Japanese breaded cutlets and stumbled upon this small establishment on a cold winter evening in January.To start off, the menu is huge and has so many choices of meat and sauces catering towards all kinds of taste buds. After spending a good 10 minutes on the menu, I opted for the cheese pork loin katsu with sweet chilli sauce. The quality of the pork was average at best, but it was deep fried to perfection. The panko batter was light and crispy, and most impressive of all, the chilli sauce complemented the meal very well. It had the right amount of tanginess and heat, and it was a fairly light sauce that definitely wouldn't leave you feeling heavy and lethargic afterwards. They also provided fresh garlic chips which added a layer of that pungent aromatic flavor on top of an already satisfying meal.For about $20, the meal set came with a side of Japanese rice, miso soup, salad, and pickled radish. The size of the katsu was big and there were 6 pieces, so I'd say price wise it is very reasonable. I consider myself a fairly big eater and I can say with complete conviction that the portion served was big enough.Overall, I had a great experience with Katsuya and will definitely be back to try out different variations of their renowned katsu dish": "positive", "Three words: Cheesy. Katsu. Goodness!I came during a weekday at 12pm (right when they opened) and the place was empty. I was seated immediately and my food came out really fast.I ordered the Original cheese katsu, specifically so I can get a great cheese pull video. It did not disappoint! The cheese was gooey and perfect! I thought the cheese to katsu ratio was great and the original sauce was the perfect addition to the dish. It wasn't heavy like a curry, it was lighter and it balanced out the heavy cheese and fried pork. The katsu itself was pretty good. The pork quality was ehhh and the panko was too fine for me. I prefer crispier katsu. I probably wouldn't get the katsu by itself, but I do like the whole combo together (cheese, katsu, and sauce).I also got the crabmeat croquette which was really good while it was fresh. When it sits for a while, it becomes a bit too creamy and squishy. The Tartar sauce / cheese / crab mixture doesn't hold up well so I recommend ordering this appetizer only if you are dining in. If I visit Toronto again I want to come back and try some of the other katsu sauces!": "positive", "Fresh. Tasty and great complimentary sides. I love the curry Katsu, it's a classic item and tastes flavourful. Been coming to the Katsuya for years": "positive", "I discovered Katsuya recently and absolutely love their offerings. I've been going to their location in Mississauga, but decided to give the downtown location a try.I was having an insane craving for the Cheese Crabmeat Croquette and ordered them in my first visit. They are light, tasty, with melted cheese in the centre and a nice tartar-like sauce on the side.In my second visit I ordered the Red Carbonara Katsu (special red sauce combined with bursting spicy and smooth creamy carbonara flavours), where the richness of the carbonara sauce with seafood is taken to the next level with a nice spicy kick. The pork loin serving size was good and it was not oily. The sauce was very tasty, but the amount of red carbonara sauce is at least 1/3 less compared to what I get at the other location I go to.Service is ok; it would be nice if they included napkins in the takeout. Street parking available on Church Street. A couple short blocks from TTC streetcar 506 on Carlton. Currently they have a 30% off promotion when paying in cash.TLDR; delicious katsu, not enough carbonara sauce for the katsu": "positive", "Passed by this place and decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint! I got the Japanese Katsu and my friend got the Katsuya original (both chicken). The katsu itself was very tender and juicy. The exterior is crunchy but not too oily. Plating was also very pretty :). Personally I did not like the sauce that came with the japanse katsu, it was a little strong and overshadowed the katsu instead of complementing it. (Others may like the taste of this sauce if you enjoy sour sauces). I really liked my friends katsuya original! That sauce was a perfect complement!": "positive", "Saw this place while I was walking around Toronto. This place is great if you're into katsu, they have verity of version of katsu. I got the original as my waiter recommended as there popular item on the menu. I feel it's great and there is no spicy to it and if you want they have Tabasco hot sauce which helps give it a kick. If you want something spicy try the spicy onion katsu. The vibe s pretty chill and they have plastic barriers between the tables to make it covid friendly. Also if you check in you get a free soda so check in. I would recommend this place, they are also part of the 100 top restaurant in Canada": "positive", "Tried the gold & silver katsu and curry katsu. The mozzarella katsu was bit overwhelming but had great flavour otherwise! Really liked the pickled veggies ban chan and the waitress offered to refill them as well. Overall great flavour, value and service": "positive", "Had a random craving for Japanese fried pork cutlet and where else than Katsuya! Had the Cheese Katsu, which is pork loin stuffed with Mozzerella cheese. The batter was light and crispy, and the mozerella was perfectly stringy. I asked for the \"original sauce\" on the side instead of ontop as I prefer to dip it to keep it crispy. The house sauce is made with \"over 5 seasonal fruits, 10 vegetables, and 6 organic herbs\" and was really flavorful with a hint of sweetness.However I did feel the accompaniments were a bit weak. For example, the shredded cabbage barely had any sauce on it, and the 2 slices of pickled radish weren't enough. But the cutlet itself is worth a try though! They do have a few locations and their items are pretty consistent": "positive", "One of my favourite places for takeout. I usually have sweet chili katsu. It comes with salad and rice - you can have extras of both if you take out and they also offer a cash discount": "positive", "Just had a god-awful take out meal from a fast food chain, and all I can think about now is whether I should order a second dinner from The Stockyards. I've been coming here since the place first opened a decade ago, and has been my go-to second kitchen during the pandemic. I don't actually eat a lot of red meat, but their griddle-smashed burgers are hard to pass-up. And remember to ask for a \"side\" of fries, as it's actually more \"trough\" sized and will feed you for days. When I'm feeling particularly hangry, I order the fried chicken, which is some of the best you'll find in the city. Support small independent businesses like The Stockyards while also cramming your food-hole with delicious comfort food - win/win for everyone!": "positive", "Came here for dinner last year while visiting Toronto. We sat at the little bar and had a great experience. Brendan got a burger and loved it. I tried the blt and it was AMAZING. The smells coming out of this place were incredible and we loved having a front row seat of all of the cooks. Hope to visit again someday!": "positive", "Let me start with I like this place and the meals I've had were good and delicious. The butter burger was very messy and tasty which was to be expected. Their classic burger was amazing. It was a well made and fresh as expected when made in front of your eyes. So the grill side of things is a well oiled machine firing on all cylinders. It is the fried chicken that underwhelmed me. It wasn't terrible and quite enjoyable as battered chicken goes, but something was lacking. I can't say it was a bad meal. It was good. But still I was left wanting more. It was a \"je ne sais quoi\" moment and I have no idea what they need here. I'm not saying don't order it but maybe it's me and my tastebuds. For others this fried chicken is exactly what they want. I'm okay with that. But me, there's an \"it\" factor missing. So I will be joyful chowing down on the excellent burgers. And I will explore the other menu items in search of new discoveries": "positive", "One of my favorite burger joints in town. The beast burger is one of the best burgers that I've ever had. It's just so juicy, flavorful and finger licking good!!! I had their bone marrow burger and that was also something. If you love the fatty and rich flavor of bone marrow, this is the one for you. If you like the juicy, flavorful and roll your eyes back deliciousness then the beast burger is the one for you. \u00a0Due to covid, they only have take out or delivery. We ordered ahead of time for pickup and everything was seemless. Sadly their menu is reduced and there is no special weekend menu but their staples are still there and their burgers are still super super good. If you don't want fries, you can get green beans or Mexican Street corn. Enjoy!!!!": "positive", "I have been ordering the fried chicken dinner from The Stockyards through DoorDash for several years. I don't know why since the fried chicken dinner has been always been disappointing for me. It must be insanity since I keep on ordering the same thing and expecting a different outcome. I guess it is because of the old raving newspapers articles that said that the Stockyards fried chicken was the best in Toronto.This time I ordered again the fried chicken dinner with fries and a BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich for my brother. My brother thought his BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich was okay. He thought his piece of chicken was kind of dry. I didn't like my fried chicken. The chicken skin was not crispy. The fried chicken was kind of dry and bland. The fries were a greasy soggy limp mess. The Stockyards should go back to cooking school and learn how to make french fries. Or just buy some regular frozen fries and use that instead.The real problem is that the other fried chicken places like Popeyes and Jolibee make better fried chicken and fries. Also their prices are much better than The Stockyards. $70.84 for crappy fried chicken and a beef brisket sandwich?In the future, I will avoid the fried chicken dinner and maybe order the hamburgers since everybody seems to like the hamburgers. I like supporting the independent small restaurants": "positive", "Oh Dear what an amazing event I just had with my mouth & belly. I ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich and it was everything I ever dreamt that it would be. It was sloppy, juicy, tasty and overflowing with Pulled Pork! It was a Pork Hurricane and I was so glad to be covered with it. This is not a dish one should have on a first date, oh heck with it if the person likes you he'll/she'll love you even more for being covered in Pulled Pork! Words cannot express how amazing this Pulled Pork was. Also the lady working the register tonight she was such a doll! A lovely lady. Great smile & a great heart. Its so nice when you find great food and great people. And their biscuits are to die for! You made my Sunday a happy one. Thank you. My stomach thanks you too": "positive", "I live in the area now, so I come here frequently for breakfast. \u00a0I love their biscuits, and their potatoes are quite tasty too. \u00a0Their service is always really friendly, and they also always have awesome motown jams playing!  Their bacon, although housemade, is a bit salty for me. \u00a0Also, they have the BEST burgers!": "positive", "Got the fried chicken dinner, very good tasting chicken, lots of fries. Also got the cheese burger, really good burger ": "positive", "Amazing food and so low key.We were trying to go to another brunch spot and was told it would be over an hour wait. Feeling hangry, we wandered down the street and into this gem. We were seated ASAP and had the best brunch! I'm a huge fan of biscuits and gravy and this really hit the spot. Husband ordered chicken and waffles which he loved as well. The service was prompt and food was delicious. What else can you ask for!": "positive", "I'd heard so many good things about the Stockyards that I assumed I'd love it. Ribs, burgers, shoe string fries and fried chicken? Sign me up!And did I mention how many people I'd heard from that this place is off the hook?? It was kismet. But I gotta' say, my experience from both my visits was...pretty average. I had the fried chicken both times, and both times, I didn't like the same things. Now, let me be clear. Theres two reasons in my opinion, \u00a0to dislike something food related: YOU don't think it was good because that's your taste or it was just terrible, the latter being it was intentionally bad. I don't think Stockyards is intentionally bad. And bad isn't what I'd classify them as. But the chicken was very... ho hum. I wasn't expecting it to taste like KFC, (this is more of a down home kitchen) but I've had the fried chicken at County General and it was AWESOME. Not here. Also, it was mostly white meat which is dry, and I feel fried chicken by default should be dark meat. Personal opinion (Also, I assumed because it isn't a fried chicken joint and this is a dinner, it wasn't possible to request only dark meat. Maybe I'm wrong? Anyhow, I didn't dock points for that).They give a whackload of fries, which is awesome, but I find the oil has a bit of that tart sour taste to it which I wasn't crazy about either. The buttermilk batter itself is pretty good, and the coleslaw is tasty. Had a piece of their home smoked bacon and it was phenomenal. Maybe if I tried something else it'd be a different experience?PROS: Staff were super friendly. Food was ready quick. Clean and easy to order system.CONS: For a soda and the dinner and tip it was over $30. A bit steep.Overall, nice joint. I'm not in that part of town very often, but if I am and give them another try, maybe the burger will be more my jam": "positive", "A reliable and delicious stop whenever I must head to the downtown core by car. Fahrenheit my lighthouse beacon painting the edge of a cold and rocky shore.If you are on Richmond heading west, STOP at Jarvis, turn left, and then take the FIRST right. Parking can be sparse but it's not unusual to find a spot right in front for the 8 minutes you need to grab and go. My faves are the East African espresso grinds they offer and the savoury scones. Always a great cup. I find all baristas here are confident and cheery when asked what's great about the day's offerings": "positive", "I've been wanting to try Fahrenheit Coffee since I first moved downtown, but never got a chance to until today (was dropping off film and it was on the way there :-).)They accept cash/coins and they have a wide selection of different types of coffees and tea(lattes).

The barista was also very friendly and it's safe to say that I enjoyed my visit": "positive", "Fahrenheit has always been a stable in my indie coffee adventures in Toronto for 10 years now. First introduced to it from the days of the Indie Coffee Passport, I'm very happy to see they now have 3 locations! No idea how I've failed to review them, so better late than never I suppose. I don't get to visit here often, but I love their vibe . I'm saying, 5 stars for them purely for their coffee products, but for me, to get 5 stars overall, it would need to give me sense that I'd be comfortable in here for a few hours with a book. And yes while those times are no more thanks to COVID, when we go back to being able to spend time in cafes I don't think Fahrenheit will be the first place I return to go spend some time with a latte and book. But don't let that deter you from coming in here to check out all their great products. I see on here that they are known for their Cortado, I suppose I know what I need to try out next time, I've tried their latte with various milk options and their flat white too which they do as good a job as anyone else out there": "positive", "Known for its quality coffee, this independent coffee chain is the perfect place for any avid coffee drinker to indulge in a caffeinated beverage and a treat. Since 2011, Fahrenheit has been offering three different espresso origins which rotate seasonally. Details of each roast are handwritten on chalkboards, making it easy to customize your beverage. The Diablo bean with oat milk is equal parts nutty and smooth. A tempting display of freshly baked scones, cookies and croissants are the perfect pairing for your Americano, latte, or Cortado (Fahrenheit's specialty drink). With two of its three locations still open during the pandemic, consider grabbing your next cup from one of its cozy shops": "positive", "Amazing coffee shop. I highly recommend trying their latte with \"Diablo\" bean and almond milk. Absolutely delicious flavour. Friendly service too": "positive", "The KISS (Keep it simple, sweetie) method is tried and true. Unassuming, unpretentious, great coffee, great baked goods, friendly staff (I mean, it IS Canada, but still). The cappuccino was delicious and just the right amount of strength. I also love that they have several coffees to choose from! I'm not coffee connoisseur enough to critique it any further.Cookie was great too, especially warmed. The location is small but great to come in for an Italian-style breakfast. The only strange thing is they have no washroom (for customers, anyway). I was referred to the hotel across the street": "positive", "Now this is what I was looking for. After being impressed but not blown out of the water by Strange Love, Fahrenheit Coffee gave me exactly what I was looking for: an amazing local coffee shop with a focus on the product driven by a fantastic team of people behind the counter. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Philz Coffee remains my favorite coffee shop in the US, and the reason behind it is because you interface as much with the barista and his or her own specialties and recommendations as you do with the institutions itself. That's the case here at Fahrenheit as well, with barista names and nicknames on the board, high fives all around, and a fantastically jovial atmosphere that really gets your day off on the right foot. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$5.10 for a medium Mocha was a reasonable price point, and everything was priced comparably down to their cookies and pastries. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?One of the other real appeals that drew me into Fahrenheit and Philz alike is the ability to choose your bean regardless of the drink you order. As I've said before, I'm not at all a coffee snob, but in choosing between three different beans for my mocha with cool little descriptions below each, I could easily become a full fledged third wave fanboy, which is a cool feeling when it's not done in a way that's intimidating. From there, my diablo fueled mocha was awesome, and I wanted to go back and order the same thing with the other two specialty beans of the day. A very cool concept. Two Stars. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Without a doubt. Star": "positive", "Single origin coffee at its finest! This tiny shop had all the signs of being a winner and when I took the first sip of my featured espresso I knew the recommendation to come here was spot on. First off, the baristas here were super friendly and made helpful recommendations, as well as inquiring about our day, where we were from, etc. They were comfortable and easy going.As noted, I was ordered the featured espresso; a Geisha varietal from La Candelilla farm in Costa Rica with notes of berries, watermelon and cocoa. It was so tart and rich! I enjoyed every drop of it.I'd recommend giving this shop a try if in Toronto, it's worth it!": "positive", "Sweet nectar of the Gods. That's how I would describe the coffee here!I'm a huge coffee fanatic and so when I finally found this Cafe I was over the moon! They have an incredible Americano, my go-to is usually the Ethiopia which has a nice floral and fruity aftertaste - absolutely no need for milk and sugar! ( which, realistically is the only way to drink coffee)In my honest opinion, this is probably one of the best coffee shops in the city... The Baristas are knowledgeable, welcome you with a smile and are extremely friendly! It's a nice little place to sit down, read a book, maybe do some work and of course enjoy your hot Cup of Joe!If you are in the area I would highly recommend you check this place out!Strong 5/5!": "positive", "This is such a cute coffee shop. Located at a street corner in downtown Toronto I ran into this place as I was going back to my hotel. I was craving some coffee so I thought why not... i'm so happy I stopped by. Everyone inside is so friendly. They have different types of coffee beans you can choose from and the different types of drinks you can make from them. They also have pastries. The shop is pretty small so there's not a ton of room to sit but it's very cute. There is outdoor parking you pay for which is street parking. The prices aren't too bad, but on the higher side, I'm not really sure if it's super expensive by Canadian standards but a small vanilla latte runs you about $4.50 (US dollars)... similar to Starbucks. I still would recommend you go here as I think the drinks are excellent. I'll be going back to try something new!

However, with Covid restrictions (ugh, I am so fed up with timed tickets!), opening hours, and our busy itinerary, we were limited in what attractions we could see, but there was an opening to go to the aquarium the morning on our last day in Toronto -- it was the perfect time slot, and we didn't want to waste our last few hours in Toronto (there were other things we wanted to see, but either the attraction opened up too late, or the limited timed tickets were sold out).Change $30 to $43, and Jennie Y's review is spot on. \u00a0At $43 a ticket (including tax, two tickets were $97.18), the aquarium wasn't worth it. \u00a0There were the typical displays of sea anemones (so pretty!), tropical fish, jelly fish, sting rays, an octopus, etc -- all very cool, but nothing I hadn't seen before. \u00a0The shark tank you could walk under was neat, but not special enough to warrant a $43 price tag.Unless you have kids, have never been to an aquarium before, or have the Toronto City Pass, I'd say skip Ripley's Aquarium -- there are so many other interesting things to see and do in Toronto.[Yelp collections: Toronto/Niagara Falls 2021; Zoos\u00a0and Aquariums]": "positive", "I would consider this one of my top 5 worthwhile must see venues in The Six!

There is a lot of different species and underwater creatures all around the world.More busy area is the kids area for sure but they also their newest walkalator to enjoy their big aquarium": "positive", "When we went, pre-pandemic, it was packed to the gills with many children running around. There are cool walkways you can stand on that move you through underwater tunnels where you can watch sharks, turtles, and fish swimming overhead. There is also a section where you can pet stingrays. Other than that, and the psychedelic lights, I can't say there is much to distinguish it from other aquariums I have been to. A note of caution: their parking garage will run you around $30, with no price listed when you enter. So it's best to find parking elsewhere nearby and walk": "positive", "I went there today, and it was beautiful. I enjoyed seeing all of the ocean life. But, when I first entered, I was waiting for a worker (who was on his phone, not busy) to tell me where to go. He scolded me, and told me to stop holding up the line, even though there wasn't a line. I just needed directions, and I'm pretty sure that's why they're being paid": "positive", "I typically do not visit Aquariums to tell you the trust, but the city pass I had included this attraction, so I figured I'd give it a shot.Was it worth it? I guess it depends on who you ask quite honestly. First off, the price tag is crazy, coming in over $30 dollars, maybe that is normal for aquariums, but I felt that was quite steep. Thankfully again, the pass covered it! Second, this is a mecca for kids, while I expected it, it did not make it easy to navigate or see everything. When you want to get up close and personal, basically I was run over by the Sandlot Crew. That is not a hit on the aquarium though honestly. The problems came down to lack of staff assistance when you lose yourself in this large complex or assistance with anything in general. I also felt it was quite run down in places and dirty to top it off. You would think with the relatively medium sized complex, it would be tidy and clean. On the plus side, you did get a lot of useful education from the different housed specimens here, so that is a huge plus if you are a sponge for wildlife. There are also tons of hands on with animals if you have the young ones with you. Overall, it was just an okay experience, I've seen better exhibits elsewhere in the world that are better priced and more interesting. A definite middle of the road review": "positive", "Love Ripley's. My son has been coming here every few months for the past 5 years. Post-Covid is nice in a way, because the crowd is much thinner. Unfortunately, surprised to see quite a few people with masks around their chins, and not respecting personal space. I feel like there should be some instruction before people enter. E.g., \"if you must remove your mask, you can do so in these designated spaces and ensure there isn't anyone around you.\" Also, maybe a warning that people who remove their masks will be asked to leave. A couple groups of guests around us would remove their masks every time staff were not around - that usually meant in the more confined spaces.PS. When will I receive a courtesy email about your two employees who tested positive? I visited on the 20th and these two cases were identified on the 22nd and 28th. Unfortunately, we had to learn of this through the news. Not very reassuring of your commitment to our safety": "positive", "Very well done. I would say that Ripley's Aquarium of Canada is a must see for visitors to the area or any lover of aquariums. Also note that the aquarium is one of the attractions included in the Toronto CityPASS, so if you invested in one, make sure to stop there. I think it rivals the big aquariums of Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, etc., in the states. It is also very family friendly, with well placed exhibits, plenty of walking space, and numerous experiential exhibits for the whole family to enjoy - I would say it is equally accommodating to kids and adults. Speaking of adults, I haven't attended but they do list a number one f \"after dark\" type events that sound pretty entertaining.One drawback I would note is the cost. If it wasn't for the favorable exchange rate right now, coming from the US, the ticket price would give me pause...especially if taking a whole family, other than that I had no issues": "positive", "2nd time and still consistently great experience.

For the main, I had Lamb Rack and it's really good. My friends had Wagyu which's additional $65 and they said it's not worth. \u00a0The last course was towards acidic instead of sweet. To my surprise, I did not finish all Petit Fours which always my fav": "positive", "The $185 tasting menu was full of creamy and sweet courses. Our server offered to \"switch\" our lamb for wagyu beef, but he failed to mention there would be an extra $65 charge. Be prepared to spend $400 per person for an OK meal. This was an extremely disappointing and overpriced experience at one of Canada's \"top\" restaurants.P.s. Christopher the Sommelier was fantastic": "positive", "With the highly coveted reservations already secured by a friend, I had absolutely no reason to decline an invitation to dinner at one of the most renowned fine dining restaurants in Toronto, perhaps even in Canada. I've had Aloette in the past and absolutely loved their menu so I was very excited to see what Alo had to offer. Asides from the rather.. interesting elevator ride up to the restaurant, which arguably felt like we were entering a speakeasy from how covert and dingy the elevator was, the overall restaurant experience was impeccable, a true reflection of fine dining. From the way the courses were meticulously served around table symmetry to the rotation and pairing of utensils for each individual dish, there was no detail that was missed. Even our lap napkins were replaced with fresh ones when we left our seats for the restroom.I have a lot of appreciation for the artistry and vision behind Chef Patrick Kriss' creation of our particular blind 9-course tasting menu (Sep 4, 2021). However, I was rather unimpressed by the execution of the Japanese-fusion twist and I had rather wished for the opportunity to experience authentic \"modern French cuisine\". Now hear me out, Japanese cuisine is undeniably my favourite cuisine of all time so perhaps my expectation for anything \"Japanese fusion\" was set too high. There's no doubt that Alo used Japanese elements and ingredients of the highest caliber in each of the courses, but I felt that the flavours of the two cuisines just didn't marry well. The appetizers and desserts, along with the foie gras tart, were mostly misses for me. Two of the appetizers that were served back to back, the burrata and the sea urchin egg yolk foam were both incredibly and overwhelmingly salty, with the latter taking away from the natural sweetness of fresh uni. The toro was served negitoro style, which from an aesthetics and palatability point of view felt inferior to what could've been an actual slice of toro. The foie gras, I can only comment that I found the yellow plum pairing far too tangy and tart. Even at the thought of it now, my face puckers. As I am not a foie gras connoisseur, I will share my friend's positive review that it was \"very smooth\". And the petit fours, the six unique desserts that acted as the finale to the meal, were all very exciting to witness being laid out on a table all at once in front of us, but didn't entice me all that much. Personally, I would've much preferred either a full traditional French tasting menu OR a full traditional Japanese tasting menu. Not a fusion that doesn't do justice to either - that's just my two cents.Now onto the dishes that really stole the spotlight for me - my three favourites in descending order were the amadai, scallop, and wagyu (+$85 in replacement of lamb). The culinary skill behind the amadai was absolutely incredible - a buttery and tender filet of fish lightly flash-fried on its backside to create crispy edible skin and scales. The jumbo scallop was my second favourite because it was also buttery and tender and served with a delicious umami crab bisque. The wagyu comes third because I thought it was an additional course for $85 rather than a replacement (couldn't hear the waiter well behind face masks). As well, my piece unfortunately had a lot of tendon. For the rest of my table, everyone commented that the wagyu was a perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience, but my piece was chewy. All in all, I felt that my tasting menu at Alo was very creative and used some very bold flavour choices. While I personally did not love every dish that was served, I can appreciate the careful thought and design that went into each recipe. Seeing as my favourite courses were mostly entrees, I would probably opt for the a la carte menu rather than the tasting menu next time, should there be one. I'm happy to say now that I've \"been there, done that\" but I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would definitely be back": "positive", "I've been waiting to eat at this restaurant for several months now.Service was not very impressive despite the only interaction we made was \"can I get some cutlery with this meal so I can eat it at a park nearby\" and got a response with \"we don't provide it\" , really? Ffs! The overall experience of the food was mediocre. I'd say the flavours are not my cup of tea. There's no wow factor to most of the courses served. Totally not worth the money, but I'll give them benefit of the doubt that it's because they are serving it thru takeout style so hard to compare to the non covid dine ins. In conclusion, this restaurant makes me feel like a sucker. Just mediocre and I'd most likely never go back": "positive", "When thinking of a restaurant for takeout, fine dining is not one that comes to mind at first. Well, this is the time to take advantage of this opportunity.Alo is one of Canada's top restaurant so good luck trying to get a reservation during a normal period. But now it's much more accessible. While you don't get the environment and particular plating of the fine dining experience. You still get to enjoy the layers of flavor, save yourself the money and pick up your own fav wines from LCBO and enjoy it at the comfort of your own home.I say a lovely experience to enjoy for a special occasion or during the holidays. The attention to detail from the first pickup. My food was in a sleek black shopping bag, the added personalization of your name printed on the menu in a nice stock paper. They also have their own Spotify playlist which you can play during your dinner to bring up the mood.We got the package during the summer and enjoyed in our newly furnished balcony in the summer and it was just the best experience. As for food it was great even the small sides like bread and soup was a highlight. I had high expectations and dessert was the only thing that fell below that. Rasberry cheese cake, wasn't bad but didn't blow me out of the park. I guess it's kind of hard to do a visually appealing dessert for take out so I don't blame them. Our set is $160 incl. tax tip for 2 in their rotating menu, less than what it would be for their dine-in experience. This could make for a wonderful gift or for a special occasion": "positive", "I was able to still try their food during the pandemic earlier this year. alo decided to switch gears and move over to #aloathome. I tried two of their sets and it was amazing! The Mother's Day brunch and also another set in June. I love that they always print out a menu to go along with it snd it feels like I'm eating there! They also offer a Spotify playlist that I used when we were eating to mimick the atmosphere :) price point is also great at $65 pp. Can't wait to be able to go back again to dine but until then it'll be alo at home :)": "positive", "This is my absolute favourite restaurant in the whole world. We went in 2017 shortly after it was opened and it definitely lived up to its hype. Each dish was meticulously placed and presented like a piece of art. The flavours were devine and a lot of thought was put into it. The servers were attentive and I loved how they curated a personal menu for us to keep at the end (with a special message for us). We returned in the summer of 2020 where the restaurant was in the outdoor tent due to COVID. The tables were spread out, all servers were equipped with PPE and it felt safe. Once again they did not fail to deliver and we had another \"best meal of our life\" experience. Will I be back? Most definitely": "positive", "Alo, topping Canada's best restaurant list for the 3rd year, has a notorious 3 month waiting list. We were lucky enough to get on the cancellation list for a weekday reso!Upon arrival, we were taken to the bar where we were welcomed with a glass of sparkling wine. And within a few minutes were taken to our table. The decor was dim and minimalist, which I assume was to place emphasis on the food.While the majority of dishes were innovative and flavourful, some courses were missing a wow factor. The notable courses were: Hokkaido Sea urchin risotto (so creamy and delicious)kanpachi with black truffle (yum), Hokkaido scallops and foie gras beignetThe optional upgraded wagyu was not as tender as we hoped, the original lamb we had was more tender in comparison. And the pork belly resembled a mediocre western take on a Chinese staple.We ordered the tasting with wine pairing for two, with one extra wagyu upgrade and one extra cheese platter which almost came to $1000.Overall a great experience except for a few dishes. Would visit again, as they have a changing, seasonal menu": "positive", "Simply the best. There's nothing much more to say. The praise is well deserved. There is nothing pretentious about this place; inspired food cooked perfectly.We went in for in person dining before COVID with high expectations, and we were blown away. When Canada gets its first Michelin star, this should be the place that nabs it. Cant wait to return": "positive", "came across this restaurant on yelp while i was planning for my Toronto trip. at first i didn't know who owned this place because the name LEE is so basic you know. could be a first name, could be a middle name, could be a last name. until i clicked the website, and it got me by surprise. turns out this restaurant is owned by THE ONE AND ONLY Susur Lee, Iron Chef Canada. a big fan of the dude. a very wholesome father too. watched a lot of his videos on youtube.so without any hesitation, we booked this place for Thursday dinner time. according to the website, they were full and only had 9.00PM seating. so we took that. our ideal time was 8.00PM.fast forward to the D-day, when we got there. it wasn't that packed. there were empty tables so we were wondering why 9.00PM table was the only slot they got. our conclusion was maybe people cancelled. anyway no biggie.we were a party of 3 (well the 4th person joined halfway our meal just to chill with us) and we ordered quite a lot.- cheeseburger spring roll - loved the idea, loved the texture, you get the crisps from the fried spring roll skin and the lettuce. taste was decent but not \u00a0as good as it looked. - braised beef - the flavor on point (the combination of sweetness and savory was just excellent) , beef was very tender. tomato confit added that acidity and freshness to it. the potato puree could be a little smoother in my opinion. but everything else was great.- caramelized cod - this is miso mustard glazed which is very classic in Japanese restaurant. you just cant go wrong with miso and black cod. but what surprised me the most was the DIMSUM RADISH CAKE, that completely was mind blowing. who would have thought to put radish cake to miso black cod? only Susur Lee would have thought this.- Roasted curry chicken - one of the best chicken curry fusion that i ever had in my life. well you cannot compare it with your authentic mom and pop chicken curry shop. the curry is more of a sauce than a broth. dish came with onion pancake which was brilliant because you can scoop the curry sauce with it. the mango dragon fruit salsa was very refreshing because the dish itself is heavy. chicken was abso-fucking-lutely juicy. loved every single condiment plated on this dish.service was a little slow. funny that the braised beef came first and the spring roll after. chicken curry came out almost half an hour after everything else came out. cocktails took forever to come out. they didnt know if they served plain steamed white rice, they had to check first. so yeah it could have been better and faster. ambiance was really cozy and a little upscale, definitely enjoyed my dinner time here.will i come back? without any doubt and i will suggest this place to all of my friends and relatives as a must-go restaurant in Toronto": "positive", "Asian fine dining on king street from iron chef susur lee - can't wait...right?Having been hyped up by his sons YouTube channel bent lee, I really wanted to check out why so many people were talking about lee. That Singapore slaw (this salad with like 30 ingredients) and that curry chicken. Singapore slaw w/ sashimi (25$+20$)It's a viet salad. I said it. Lemon grass. Carrots. A bunch of other veggies all shredded up with some nice sauces. It's basically a rice roll at phoanhvu but deconstructed. Add some sashimi for the flavour of fat, at a steep price. Curry chicken with onion pancake (30$)It's a hainan chicken style with a few drops of curry and a poorly done Chinese onion pancake. It barely resembles curry as it's splattered on the dish underneath, and the pancake was lukewarm and hard. Beef roast w/potatoes (30$)By far the best dish. But this is just a Canadian Sunday dinner? Beef is warm and very tender. Loved the potatoes. Charles would not repeat. Not even if his income doubled": "positive", "We celebrated a friends birthday at Lee on a Saturday night. It was busy but we were well taken care of by our server and staff. I started off with the Singapore slaw and cheeseburger rolls. The slaw is super unique (I hate bitting into the ginger though), but otherwise really good. I also had the beef and chicken dumplings, both came with a great sauce. I preferred the chicken over beef. The cod was delicious. Highly recommend. I really enjoyed the pad thai too. I was excited for the turnip cake that came with the cod but unfortunately it wasn't really authentic/ nothing like the ones you get from dim sum. I had high hopes for the curry chicken since it's their award winning dish. It was good, but I wasn't wow'd by it. I got the lychee ginger beer drink and that was delicious. I loved it. We also bought a cake for cutting, I expected a cake cutting fee but it was $60 when we got the bill, which I thought was a bit expensive. The sever mentioned their meals are meant to be shared family style. And suggested one large/main meal would be enough for two people. So glad we didn't listen and all got our own mains because even after four apps split amongst 3 people, we were all able to finish our own mains (all of us are petite female) + cake afterwards": "positive", "Came here to try the slaw, was not disappointed. Its a really good salad with tons of ingredients and lots of crunch! However I recommend eating it earlier in the meal as the crunch is not as strong later on in the meal as the salad starts to get soggy.We also ordered:- The Top Chef curry roasted chicken: This was sooo good! The chicken was so moist and the curry was delicious. - Black cod: omg. The cod was so delicate my fork could barely hold it up, and then it just melted in your mouth. Definitely recommend, but it is on the smaller side/not as filling as the curry roasted chicken.We ordered a sangria as well, which was delicious and had lots of fruits in it. The service was great, and the server recommended 3 dishes for the two of us. He was right, after the slaw, chicken and cod, I was stuffed.It was our anniversary and they surprised us with a chocolate peanut butter bar. This one actually really impressed me- I did not expect it to be that good! The peanut butter taste was not as overwhelming as these types of bars usually are. Half of the bar is a smooth chocolate and the other side is crunchy and crispy, which gives a nice contrast in taste. Would definitely order this dessert next time!": "positive", "I was very excited to try this restaurant but unfortunately found that it is extremely overhyped and overpriced. I don't mind paying any type of money for good food but unfortunately this wasn't up to par. The famous signature slaw was just okay but the sashimi was nowhere near fresh. The cheeseburger spring rolls were good, just heavy and overpriced. The chicken was really moist but curry was just okay. The cod was really good but not the best fish I've ever had where I would go back again just for that dish. Moving onto the desserts, I did not like the tong Yuen at all to the point where we didn't even finish it. The panna cotta was a bit better but I have had way better panna cotta at many other places. Service was great though but I will not be coming back": "positive", "Unassumingly upscale - maybe I'm naive, but this place caught by me off guard. It's next to a beloved neighbourhood pub and I didn't realize it was a real dining experience - amazing vegan/vegetarian options and cocktails and my meat-eating comrades adored the dishes they tried. I have had great servers and enjoyed my conversations with them every time. Try the salad, the cheeseburger spring rolls, and the lettuce wraps!": "positive", "I won't lie I was drawn to this place by the many Instagram pictures I've seen of their salad. The salad was pretty good. My only problem is yes I wanted to take a picture before It was even on the table the server started mixing it up. I'm not sure why but yeah I didn't get a picture ok not a big deal I just didn't expect it to be tossed on the table getting salad everywhere. Taste wise it was pretty good. Very fresh and light I would probably order it again. That was probably the best part of the meal. The cheeseburger rolls were pretty unique and tasty. I wasn't blown away by the cheeseburger spring roll concept but I wasn't disappointed. The other two courses were mediocre at best. I was very disappointed in the octopus. It lacked flavour, was chewy despite the waiter telling me how it was so tender snd not chewy before I bit into it. Makes me think he also sensed it was over cooked. The chicken on the other hand was cooked perfectly and very juicy. The flavour of the coconut curry was good but not spectacular, It kind of lacked any real wow factor taste wise. Presentation of everything was really nice. A+ for plating the food. Taste though was really lacking on everything but the salad. I have heard great things and my partner had been here before. Maybe this was an off day. It's not a cheap place so I would probably save the money and go somewhere less Instagram asian fusion and more ugly presentation with good food": "positive", "Highly overrated.What I triedOyster shooter. This dish was a great flavor combination and the only memorable dish of the meal.Slaw salad. This salad had a nice combination of flavors and textures but was nothing of note.Sea bass. The fish was cooked well and I enjoyed the glaze. The accompaniment flavors did not go well with the fish.Braised beef. The fish was very boring and the beef slightly dry": "positive", "The best restaurant we have tried in Toronto so far! \u00a0The food was incredible! \u00a0Tasty, unique flavor combinations and creative. \u00a0Service was knowledgeable and friendly. \u00a0Drinks and wine list are excellent too. \u00a0They even had a Sangria cart. \u00a0:)": "positive", "You need to try the Singaporean Slaw!!!It's a 11/10 as far as salads go! So many different flavours and textures in a single salad. Their other food though is just okay. But 5/5 for that salad": "positive", "Great flavours and good sized portions. I really enjoyed the noodle texture! One of the best ramen spots downtown and I will definitely go back.Only downside is the restaurant is quite small": "positive", "Best ramen spot in Toronto hands down. The broth is very thick and rich, just like how it is in Japan. The noodles are soft but bouncy at the same time, \u00a0dry satisfying when you chew on it. The cha shu is thick and tender, braised for hours. \u00a0Please be sure to order the soft soy egg, the yolk is runny and flavour is on point. I also usually get the extra bamboo shoot on the side. Much more better than your average Ramen shop here in Toronto": "positive", "Easily one of my favourite ramen shops in Toronto and the GTA!My friend and I stumbled upon Hokkaido Ramen Santouka on a rainy Friday evening, after we couldn't decide what to eat. We decided to give this place a try since it was close to where we were living, and boy did it not disappoint!Upon seating, our waiter kindly recommended the toroniku (simmer pork jowl), after noticing that both of our orders (Negi Meshi Bowl Combo with the Shoyu Ramen, and the Grilled Salmon Bowl Combo with the Miso Ramen) didn't include the specialty item - I'm so glad we got the separate appetizer. We were amazed at how tender and soft the toroniku came out. It was absolutely succulent and delicious, basically tearing apart at the muscles as we picked it up with our chopsticks. The marinade was just savoury enough to have a nice depth of flavour without ruining the natural flavour of the pork. It came with a side of scallions, which helped to clean your palate after every bite. I also tried combining both in one bite; the scallions of which offered a refreshing coolness to cut the richness of the toroniku.The shoyu ramen and miso ramen were absolute divine - first sips of the broth yielded deep, rich, and hearty flavours. This was definitely a broth that would warm you up on a cold rainy day. The ramen noodles themselves had a consistent bite throughout the meal, never once feeling soggy as if they absorbed too much broth. The cha shu itself was seared perfectly, with a perfect ratio of fat-to-meat. Unfortunately, we did feel as if the broth was a little too salty for our taste buds - but nevertheless, a great ramen indeed! For the next time, I think we'll try to adjust the broth richness. We saw on the menu that it was customizable, but didn't think too much about it seeing that our waiter didn't ask.Moving onto the Negi Meshi itself, I was pleasantly surprised at how the simple combination of rice, dried bonito, green onions and soy sauce came together in such a balanced dish. I found that the sweetness from the soy sauce helped to balance out the umami from the dried bonito, with the green onions adding a splash of freshness into every bite. Definitely one of my more memorable bites of the evening. The Grilled Salmon bowl was delicious - I just wish there was more salmon!I can't wait to come back again!": "positive", "I haven't had ramen in a while. \u00a0It is one of the things I really missed during this pandemic. \u00a0As like my previous reviews, I'm hesitant to order it via your local delivery service as it doesn't stay hot. \u00a0Unfortunately its always transported in a container you can't heat in the microwave. \u00a0Nobody likes luke warm soup. \u00a0I like mine piping hot. \u00a0I am now on the look out for restaurants who have the best take out containers.Here's a cool one. \u00a0I bit the bullet and ordered from this place. \u00a0How cool are these containers. \u00a0They had stacked the soup, noodles and toppings in the same container. \u00a0Or in its own compartment. \u00a0The soup stayed hot and the noodles stayed chewy which is what should be. \u00a0Hokkaido alway had great broth and I'm quite happy it didn't disappoint even as take out. \u00a0They have maintained their quality. \u00a0Service: \u00a0it was efficient and friendly. \u00a0It is unfortunate I can't discuss further as the interactions during the pandemic is limited especially for take out": "positive", "Really good ramen, quick and friendly service, they yell what I assume are nice things to you in Japanese when you come in and leave. Chasu and what I remember as pork cheek ramen were both delicious. Great spot would definitely come back if I'm ever in Toronto again": "positive", "PERFECT FOR A RAINY DAY! Super hearty and authentic ramen. Not overly salty or bland and the portions are perfect. I love the texture of their noodles and the broth is so satisfying on a cold day. Expect a pretty long wait since no reservations are taken here": "positive", "Hands down one of my favorite ramen spots ever. My husband and I happened upon this place during one of our visits to Toronto, and the small line at the door piqued our interest. We saw that we had 5 minutes until opening, so we thought, \"why not\", and got in line.We were seated right away (obviously), and saw that they had they had a special Pork Jowl Ramen on their menu. They only make a certain amount of the special each day, and when it's out, it's out. We both ordered the special and to our delight, the noodles and broth came out piping hot, and the toppings were served separately on a side dish. Some people may have found this odd, but we liked it because we were able to control how soaked we wanted the meat to be. We've often gone to ramen shops where the meat has disintegrated due to the high heat of the broth, and high heat can cause the meat to release extra oil into the broth, so if you don't drink it fast, it starts to feel unpleasant as the fat begins to coagulate. The broth was DELICIOUS; the flavors were well rounded, hearty, and so savory. I'm literally salivating as I write this. We fell in love after this meal, and marked it as one of our \"must haves\" whenever we visit Toronto.On our next visit to Toronto, we took my husband's cousin with us. Again, we got to the restaurant before opening and stood in a small line. My husband and his cousin ordered the Pork Jowl Ramen again, but I tried the Tsukemen Ramen this time. The noodles come cooked in a bowl, and your broth is served separately. It was my first time having Tsukemen, and I enjoyed my experience. I was able to dip my noodles, and the broth coated the noodles with flavor. I enjoyed being able to sip the broth without having a ton of noodles rushing toward my mouth as I tipped the bowl toward me. I honestly dream about this place since we don't have an authentic Ramen shop back home, and I was so disappointed when TED was cancelled in Vancouver in 2019 since I was supposed to work the event and was adamant that Hokkaido was going to be my first meal when I landed.I'm looking forward to being able to travel to Canada again in the near future (hopefully) so that I can visit this place again!(I won't be posting any photos since it looks like there's about 50 pictures of the same things that have already been posted)": "positive", "Favorite ramen in town. Authentic miso ramen from Hokkaido": "positive", "I love Ramen.I think I've been to almost every Ramen shop in Toronto. Despite trying many Ramen, from Tokyo to instant varieties, this place is one of my top 3 favourites. My favourite is the kara-miso which is their spicy ramen. this one costs $1 more which is worth it if you like spicy. I've also tried and enjoyed their regular miso ramen and the dipping ramen. TBH, I do not enjoy the dipping ramen though. I also do not like the sour plum they put on one of the ramens because it is too sour, but I know some of my friends like it.The service here is also extremely fast. The only downside here is that their portions are literally the smallest I ever saw and at a price that is higher than average. I also don't think there is an option for how hard you want your noodles, or maybe the servers just dont ask?": "positive", "I called ahead to inquire if they had a veggie broth or beef (since I don't eat pork) I was told yes over the phone. Sadly, no they don't. So if you don't eat pork, ramen here isn't an option. However, with that in mind, there is one dish that I was able to eat. I ordered the shrimp salad and I was not disappointed. Originally, I really wanted ramen hence \u00a0why I called before hand. Not to worry though. The shrimp salad was worth it. It's just noodles with lettuce and shredded veggies and shrimps. There was not broth but the noodles were cooked enough that it wasn't necessary. It still tasted like ramen just without the broth": "positive", "This place was delicious that my fianc\u00e9 and I came here twice during our Toronto trip (on our birthdays!) The lyonnaise breakfast potatoes are exquisite and perfectly seasoned. I had the Montreal Benny one day and the Eggsuberant the other day.

The Eggsuberant was a classic delicious breakfast and it was exactly what I needed after a night out.

The French toast was fabulous as well!": "positive", "I used to come here almost every Saturday morning for years. the staff were very friendly, at least the ones a few years ago.the space is pretty nice, but sometimes you can really smell the kitchen. the food is mediocre, not unlike most breakfast places": "positive", "Overall this meal was Flavorless.Came in for brunch.I had the avocado toast. There wasn't any seasoning of any kind. It was just a bland dish. My group all said the same about their dishes.I ordered a vanilla latte and it came with about half of the cup full of syrup. I asked them to please make another one and this one just tasted watered down. The server was really nice, but the food unfortunately was a disappointment": "positive", "In Montr\u00e9al I've eaten here dozens of times. Canadians do breakfast right. The best deal (albeit not cheap) is two eggs, potatoes and two pancakes or two French toast and Canadian style turkey bacon. We also had a berry smoothie. The plate is assembled neatly, two eggs are enough even if it doesn't look like much in the plate. The French toast is great, the pancakes were a little burned or overcooked. \u00a0I don't recall a breakfast place burning pancakes before so I told off a star. But normally it should be good.

Great food for all that I order. The pancakes were fluffy with a little crisp on the edge. Had the lobster eggs Benedict which was great. Went for the eggspectation omelette which was delicious.

Would recommend to anyone": "positive", "The food and restaurant is the same as what I remembered when my friend and I dined here at Tinuno a few years ago. All we could remember was how dry and rubbery the fish was.. and too much of our surprise, it was still the same food quality as before. Nothing has really changed. I've been advised by many people who have dined here that it isn't the best place for Kamayan feast and there are much better ones in Toronto. However, the price is pretty cheap ($18.95 per person) for the amount of food we had so quantity over quality here. If you pay cash, taxes are excluded. Funny enough, among us five who dined here yesterday, we said that the garlic rice was the only tasty item in this Kamayan feast. It is certainly worth the first try but I wouldn't come back again. I'm looking forward to redeem my Kamayan experience at Casa Manila next week": "positive", "Being part Filipino it was great to visit one of Toronto's few sit-down Filipino restaurants. The menu is filled with signature Pinoy dishes, but if you are here the Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fight is the reason for eating sit-down. Not eating it is the equivalent of not getting All-You-Can-Eat at an AYCE Sushi Place, or ordering Ala Carte from a Korean BBQ Place. The food is delicious and reminiscent of authentic Filipino cuisine, which is expected since the staff/chefs are actually Filipino/Filipina. The mussels, chicken/pork, shrimp and other meats are all marinated and cooked to be very moist and the rice and salad are seasoned perfectly. The only downside of the restauraunt is the size. Traditionally Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fights are shared with large families or large groups of friends. At this location its only a small amount of tables which max out at maybe 4-6 people? Because of this its hard to host a large gathering here without having to rearrange pretty much every table in the place. Fortunately they do offer takeout, however it isnt as authentic as the leaf on table servings": "positive", "As a big fan of Filipino dishes, I am so disappointed of how they cook/ prepare their food.

I'd rather buy somewhere else or cook it myself": "positive", "My sweetie and I ventured into Toronto's Upper Jarvis / St. James Town neighbourhood for a late traditional Filipino lunch.After paying for Toronto P street parking about 100 metres away, we walked to this old renovated house turned restaurant, which also now shares a common pathway to a health & wellness business upstairs.We waited 10 minutes in the very small corridor, showed our provincial vaccine passports to allow us to dine indoors, and were then seated at a window table (which made us feel safer based on the narrow venue layout).Our server was very courteous & efficiently tending to our dining experience.We ordered the Tinuno signature Kamayan Feast for $18/person. \u00a0It was served on a wooden board loaded with Milkfish (..Tilapia was the other choice), squid, mussels, shrimps, pork belly, BBQ pork, garlic rice, eggplant, okra, slices orange, and mango salad.The beverages selected? \u00a0A can of Coconut Water and a can of Calamansi.What was the dining intrigue? \u00a0No utensils; you're given a pair of thin plastic gloves to feed yourself! \u00a0Wow, I thought this was fascinating.Final thoughts: fresh seafood, excellent service, rice served was harder than our preference, would be nice if Tinuno offered a chicken or beef substitution for pork. \u00a0We will return for another terrific meal!": "positive", "I love this place. I've been here a handful of times and even had my birthday here (pre-Covid). The unlimited garlic fried rice is my favourite part. I love eating kamayan style (with your hands) and on banana leaves. The price is also very reasonable for what you get! The staff are so kind and friendly. My parents were born in the Philippines so this was a real treat for them. There's a small room on the second floor which was able to house my large group of 16-18 people for my birthday. I highly recommend this place!": "positive", "The Kamayan feast has always been solid here. My first time here (pre-covid) that bed of garlic rice made such an impression on me. We ordered takeout recently because I had a craving for that delicious meal. The grilled items on the feast were very tasty. But unfortunately the rice on the bottom was cold and started to turn hard. We also ordered the crispy pata (pork hock) and while the skin was crispy, the meat was a bit hard and dry.My rating is partly based on my original dine-in experience. If based on take out, only 3 stars. This type of meal is best enjoyed in store!": "positive", "It was a really cool experience to share with friends. Although the restaurant is small, but since we are sharing the food, we all sat relatively cozily to eat the food off the table with our hands. Food was well seasoned and very flavourful. I had a really enjoyable time trying this out! My favourite is the garlic rice, I wish I could eat it everyday": "positive", "Ordered our first every Kamayan Feast and was not disappointed! The pictures feast cost $36 + $4 for 3 pieces of extra shrimps and 3 mussels- great deal right?! The service was amazing, food was also delicious. I especially like the charred milkfish and shrimps, the meat skewer was okay and pretty tasty": "positive", "Made reservations here after a friend suggested it. Such an amazing experience and so much fun to eat. We were a party of 5 and had the Kamayan feast with garlic rice, mussels, shrimp, pork belly pork skewers, roasted okra, eggplant and mango salad. It also came with milk fish and tilapia. There was so much food but we still made room for dessert. I loved the Cassava Cake and would go back for the ube ice cream next time! The spread was awesome. Wish I took a picture before we devoured everything!": "positive", "Back in the day when I would go to NYC twice a year just to eat pizza I would long for that desired mouthfeel, the fresh tomato sauce and the char on the bottom of the pizza. And that brings me to Detroit... style?? Although better than the deep dish in the CHI (lou malnatis. UNO) we have a contender for the best pizza in Toronto. A 30-60 minute wait for four/eight slices (S/L) will have you coming back for more. Having tried the pepperoni and no name, the burnt thick crust edges, crisping hard complimented by the fresh tangy tomato sauce and whatever toppings you may have on your pie leave you coming back for more. There's something about these thick slices that make me want to try every single one of these (maybe not the Canadian and veggie option). 5/5": "positive", "Definitely worth a try.A special occasion treat, enough for two for dinner despite the size because it's thickness and density is quite filling.We got the No Name pizza which had great topping, except for the ricotta which was a bit too thick and wet.Highly recommended": "positive", "Hands down the best pizza my partner and I have ever tried in our lives - the crust was mind blowing. We've tried a couple of flavours but No-Name and the Truff-ghi are to write to every single one of your friends and family about!! (the Barese was good but not life changing). Best dip for this is the hot honey.Definitely more on the pricey side but the quality is very worth it for special occasions or if you just want to have the best comfort night in": "positive", "TRUFF-GHI- STRONG mushroom flavour- the white truffle sauce is sooo good!- We got a side of House Ranch and dipped it with the pizza and jsandjasn, this combo was pretty good too LOL - Whole box came piping hot :DELECTRIC AVENUE- Ngl, this was pretty spicy!!! So don't use as much of the hot sauce (Diablo's Fuego hot sauce) if you can't handle it...- The crust was crunchy and delicious!OTHERMan, this place is so good! I pretty much have nothing but praise for it, and it was definitely worth the 45 minute wait- which was also extremely accurate as we came back exactly after 45 minutes and our order was ready to go. Both the pizzas had very fresh tasting ingredients and came out nice and hot. One slice of each basically filled me up LOL, especially since they're pretty thick slices. Pizza lover or not, I highly recommend anyone in the area to give this place a try if you have time to spare (waiting). I'm definitely going to come back again to try more of their pizzas!": "positive", "If I could give a half star I would The pizza is over rated and over priced no gluten free options ... the dough was nasty and wasn't that great very very greasy , it had something hard in it almost chipped my tooth !!!!

BOTH are very good. The funghi is slightly better but damn, they make some good pizza!!!We ordered at 6pm and the wait was 2 hours. When we got it, it was steaming hot. It may look like deep dish but it's not. Majority is fluffy airy crunchy pizza bread. More carbs is the best, I say! Lots of toppings and so it was the perfect combo for me. And. So. Worth. The.

Drool": "positive", "First time trying Detroit-style pizza and it's pretty special. If I could describe it, it's like marrying focaccia and pizza dough together and Descendant makes a killer pizza.We ordered take-out and had a great experience with the staff, super friendly! Truff-ghi - loaded with a ton of mushrooms, cheesy and a nice balance with the creamy truffle sauce and caramelized onion for a bit of sweetness Jaffna - good amount of heat (not too spicy), definitely a unique flavour with a punch of indian flavour and a load of spicesBoth flavours were great and every bite had a load of ingredients and flavour! The crust had a super crisp exterior and nice and pillowy interior. Also love how they fill the toppings right to the edge of the pizza!I will say it is a bit pricey, the small is ~$20 for four slices but definitely worth it!": "positive", "GB Hand-pulled noodles is incredible! You get the full experience of seeing them making the noodles and BANGING them on the table. This is a great lunch spot for me and my co-workers. We typically come 30 minutes before the lunch rush to avoid how busy it could get. Overall the flavour of the soup is excellent, you can choose the type of noodles to get, and best of all, add as much chilli oil as you want": "positive", "Value for money noodlesService: The staff are friendly, they check your temperature before you walk in and you write down your information for contact-tracing. Food:Ordered a mega bowl of lanzhou noodles, one of two in our group. It's definitely a huge bowl, big enough for two people to share, but the ratio of the beef and other ingredients (radish, cilantro) seemed to be off and it was just a lot of soup and noodles. Ended up finishing it solo, but it was definitely a struggle at the end, would recommend getting a large for one, or mega with extra beef if sharing. The noodle texture was nice and springy/chewy, you can customize the thickness and you can see they pull the noodles by hand inside. The broth was on the lighter side, but the chili oil helped flavour it. Also had the cucumber and jelly fish and the flavours were spicy and tangy, spot on!Overall: Good spot if you're craving hand-pulled noodles": "positive", "this is the perfect place to grab a quick bite to eat. the service is friendly and fast. I personally love any type of noodle soup and if you add hand pulled noodles...well that is just the cherry on top. this soup is savory and light but still has a deep beef flavor. I like the chili oil added on top and asked for extra scallion for garnish. I got the regular/small size which has 5 slices of thinly sliced beef on top of extra wide noodles. the chew on the noodles is amazing. I think in hindsight I would go for wide noodles instead.I'm sad I was only visiting and couldn't try more of the menu but this was the perfect place for my last brunch!": "positive", "Came here with a friend on a Thursday night. Super yummy and fast service. The waiter was also very friendly. I ordered their signature noodles and the noodles had the perfect amount of spring and chew to them. The meat was also very tender and melted in your mouth. The pickled eel was also super yummy. Would definitely come back again": "positive", "Just as I am writing this review, I want to go get some hand-pulled noodles right now! \u00a0Consistent deliciousness in a hot steaming bowl, perfect for winter, huge portions and it tastes even better the next day. \u00a0The service at this location is your old-school Asian-style, get to the point, order your food and receive your food almost immediately. \u00a0You are thanked at the door (take-out only due to covid), and everyone wears a mask.I recommend getting a thick noodle cut, I like the wide noodles. \u00a0I get the standard fare, with standard chilis and it's just the perfect amount. \u00a0They even pack some on the side for you in case you need more. \u00a0I sometimes have a hard time finishing, and guess what? \u00a0It tastes even better the next day.5-stars for the excellent value, and the predictable and quick service. \u00a0A huge bowl of noodles for $12, and hand-pulled noodles... honestly, how can you go wrong?": "positive", "Covid delivery review!First off GB Hand pulled noodles is my favourite dine-in soup go to. Easily 5/5. The delivery experience though not as good is still great to try.The beef noodle soup came separate and you had to mix it together. Disappointed I had no choice of the type of noodle I wanted. Tasted just like the dine in experience however. Just ensure you get fast delivery so you can eat it hot!I also got the roasted pork ribs. Didn't really seem \"roasted\" but tasted good regardless and got a big portion size which I was happy about.Soups are hard to get perfect via delivery, however GB Hand Pulled noodles comes close. I'd recommend the beef noodle soup if you are reading this": "positive", "GB hand-pulled noodles?? More like machine-pulled noodles. This used to be a great spot for fresh hand pulled noodles a few years ago but the quality has drastically gone down. The noodles I ordered did not seem to be hand pulled but were instead made with the machine, which I saw in the kitchen. I ordered the tomato minced pork noodles - toppings were sparse and cold, noodles were soggy before even being mixed with the sauce. Most restaurant prices have gone up since COVID which I understand but at the price point they charge here, I would still expect much better quality than this. Do not come here, there are a lot better choices in Toronto, especially in the Yonge Dundas area": "positive", "Tucked away at the north east corner of Edward St and Bay St is GB Noodles. The restaurant has adapted during covid19 with their patio area, which is an extension on the sidewalk and not dangerously on the street (like some other restaurants). Takeout seems to be the popular choice and the ordering counter is now right at the door. Ordering is fast and efficient. I understand that the noodles are the star of the show, but I wish there were more topping options. I pretty much saw either minced pork or slices of beef. Also some veggies (like bok choy) would be a \u00a0nice addition. There's a wide variety of noodle thickness and I went for an order of thick and thin. I agree with some reviewers that thick noodles give it a bit more texture and chewiness. But I prefer the thin noodles. The soup is clear and generally is smooth tasting, with a bite as a finish - an acquired taste.Overall, not bad and I did appreciate the noodles. However there are many noodle options in Toronto nowadays and I'm likely to rather give a new place a try.Thanks GB Noodles for the tasty lunch!": "positive", "Flavourful broth and fast service.

Nestled in the King Street corridor, their Ritual pick up is super smooth - very efficient grab and go. Food is 4.5 stars: tacos are a sophisticated set of flavours that tickle the pallet (order at least 3 if hungry) and their steak fajitas are tasty too. Limited seating on the patio so plan ahead. Have always been a very reliable quick dinner. I do really like that they are open 7 days a week unlike other taco places. Great patios in the area to visit right after. Perfect for a casual friend meet-up": "positive", "My favourite place for sizzling steak fajitas. I missed the hot plates so much during the lockdown.

The thing that makes Fresco stand out amongst other fish and chips shops is that the have gluten free batter as an option which is actually still very pleasant. The fries are top notch delicious. I think they're double fried and are crispy but fluffy all at once. The shrimp were good and all a very consistent in size which was nice. Overall, a good meal. The restaurant itself is cute and has nice decor": "positive", "Fantastic fish and chips that may be the best in the city. I can say to date these are the best pieces of halibut that I have ever had for fish and chips. The sizes appear average at first blush but the quality of fish is fantastic.

Definitely try the fish and shrimp combo!": "positive", "$14 for 2 pieces of fish of your choice, for which I ordered cod (they had haddock, and halibut listed inside; about $5 for 1 piece if sold separately/extra), with fries (about $3 extra to make it a poutine, which I did),and a tiny \u00a0container of (unpleasant) tartar sauce and 2 lemons slices (awesome!). I asked for the 'Miss Vickie's extra crisp batter' which was about $2.00 extra. $14 for all that is a good deal for the location. The poutine portion was massive. \u00a0Not bad. Miss Vickie's extra crisp batter was \u00a0underwhelming.The fish were fine. BUT please make sure you let the fish cool down, or the batter falls off easily.The main gripe i had is the tartar sauce: it tasted like the sweet tartar that Heinz makes. Inexcusably sweet in flavour. Best tartar sauce Im comparing it to was/is the Whole Foods hot bar tartar sauce from Yorkville. Overall, doesnt beat the fish and chips that Yorkville Whole Foods offered/offers Friday evenings after 4 PM. WF use a beer batter that clung to the fish fillet.And WF tartar sauce is night and day better (at least not sweet!)": "positive", "Must see when you are in Toronto area.Contemporary of our revolving restaurant in downtown Vancouver.The restaurant on the top is called 360Amazing cuisines.Bisy place and I dont know where is the parking,the hotel I stayed is just across the street and the Ripleys aquarium is adjacent to the tower.Busy land mark of Toronto .And a lot more taller that our revolving resto in Vancouver.Main floor is a huge store where you can buy a lot of stuff.Souvenir i believed is cheaper outside.I had fun during my visit and Ienjoyed our dinner as well.Kudos CN Tower": "positive", "Ambience - 10/10You really cannot beat the ambience of dining at the CN Tower. From the moment we passed security, we were greeted with nothing but friendly smiles, and we knew that we were in for a treat. Once we got up to the restaurant, we were quickly brought to our seats, and were in awe at the view. We went at night, so seeing all the glistening lights across the GTA was truly a treat. The entire vibe was very romantic, and perfect for couples. Food - 9/10I got an appetizer of Steamed PEI Mussels and a main of lamb. The serving of mussels was very generous, and they provide a few pieces of bread with it to soak up the sauce at the bottom of the pot, which was a very nice touch. The lamb was incredibly tender, and cooked perfectly! Service - 9/10Service was phenomenal, and we were treated so well. If I wanted to be extremely nit-picky, the only flaw throughout the entire night was that we waited for ~10 minutes to get the bill after we asked for it. BUT with the view that you get while dining, we didn't mind the wait at all! This place is definitely on the pricey side, so I suggest saving this for a special celebration or occasion. Trust me, it will be even more amazing!": "positive", "Best to make dinner reservation at CN Tower 360 view restaurant then walk down to their glass viewing deck. The food and ambience are amazing up top while moving around 360 view. You can't get this anywhere else in Toronto. If you get the dinner then it is included in package for ticket to see 2 floor down while walking underneath the glass. I really enjoys the seafood platter come with lobster, crab, mussels, oysters, shrimps, and scallop. The 8oz tenderloin steak with mash potatoes was cool to perfection. They even provide you free dessert for birthday celebration. The chocolate sphere was so pretty when they pour the hot chocolate over. At the end they gives you few more chocolate to pair with your champagne.

The admission fee is $40 per person": "positive", "What do you do when you have 48 hours in a world class city like Toronto? You get a birds eye view of course! While the CN Tower is a popular attraction, there are days and times when it can feel like it's all yours! This is especially true if you get the extra ticket to go up to the very highest observation deck -- which doesn't get the same foot traffic the main observation deck does. I was lucky to experience": "positive", "Awesome experience that you need to do in toronto. Pro tip is to buy dinner at the restaurant and then you also get the trip included in the price. The trip itself is almost as much as making a reservation for food so you might as well get a meal out of it while you take in breathtaking 360 views of Toronto. If you're want to see more try the pod at the top for an extra fee but spectacular views. Don't miss the glass floor": "positive", "It's a must for tourists and it makes a great backdrop for pictures, but maybe it's a bit outdated. \u00a0It certainly will not stand the test of time like the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building. \u00a0If only they could replace it with another icon! \u00a0 But if you are new to Toronto it's a must to check out. \u00a0Bring your pocketbook, it's not cheap. \u00a0Especially if you eat at their 4 star restaurant": "positive", "Somehow this has always been in the back of my mind in terms of a must to do...no clue why. Queue tourist trap money grab, but seriously what large tower view isn't nowadays? I had purchased a city pass which included the tower, so I was not gonna miss out on it! This was also the perfect day to do so, since it was 7 degrees outside with negative temps with wind chills (No bueno for this Californian). Lines were relatively short and the ride up is unlike any other tower experience I have come encountered with. Typically you are stuck in an elevator with no views, until you get to the top, not here though. On your way up, you get to view all the way down the building and scenes from around Toronto with its outward facing windows. The ride itself to the top is short, so make sure you have your camera ready if you want those iconic shots you see littered all over the page. Before we talk about the two upper levels, make sure you hit the attraction on a clear day. I was short on my tourist days, so I opted to hit it on a winter day with heavy overcast. This ended up giving me terrible distant views, while I could catch decent near shots of downtown Toronto, outside of that, no luck. Moving forward with the idea of a clear day visit. The top floors have what you expect, food and drink options with places to sit and take in the views. They also have staff walking around educating you on parts of the city and the tower itself, which I found very valuable. In the end, would I hit the tower again, probably not by myself due to the price tag. If a friend was with me though who had never seen it, I would join immediately though!": "positive", "I had much more expectations from CN tower restaurant chefs. The salmon was ok-ish. The bar needs to upgrade their drink menu. Overall cleanliness , hygiene at its best. For the money they charged me I could have got better food .

To access it, you need to use your QR code scanner app to scan the QR code found at your table. We ordered three different special sushi rolls and two bottles of hot sake. The portion size of each of the sushi rolls were big and the fillings were ample (yum!). The hot sake was great as well. It was a lovely way to enjoy a cold winter evening. My friends drank most of the hot sake and they said that they loved every sip! We didn't have any room for dessert, so that'll be for next time!": "positive", "First of all awesome service. The waitresses here are so nice - they even checked the song that I liked on their playlist and wrote me down the name.Secondly, great food.

I got the B option on the lunch menu ($17) which had 10 PCs sashimi and a spicy salmon roll. It was supposed to come with miso soup and a salad but we got scammed but I'll forgive them because their sushi was fire. All the sushi was very well made. A bit pricey but nothing crazy for the quality of sushi. \u00a0Will definitely come again for their sushi! loved it": "positive", "TAKE ME BACK!! Such amazing food that is hasn't left my mind since it hit my tongue! Everything was the perfect combination of flavours I'm having a hard time making proper sentences it was so good!

We couldn't decide where to eat, but the car was already stopped right in from Saku which is just a few steps away from Raku. So then we went to Saku. We tried to order the Saku roll but it was out. We tried to ordered a nabeyaki udon but it was out. It's sad when so many things aren't there. We finally ordered the Ocean Dream roll and salmon pressed sushi and a sashimi sampler. Everything was average, not bad": "positive", "Heard great things about their aburi sushi set and had to try it! Came here with my friend who is vegetarian. I ordered the aburi sushi set, my friend got the vegetable Gyoza, yam and avocado rolls and Peter Pan rolls. The set was incredible, the sushi were perfectly torched and the sauces were an amazing complement to the Individual pieces. I tried my friends sushi as well, the Peter Pan roll was excellent. It was great to find a place with more vegetarian options than cucumber and avocado rolls. I would highly recommend this place :))": "positive", "Love this place! I have tried their Fried chicken, Aburi platter, and sushi rolls! Their food is alway fresh and love their green tea tooThere is parking Behind the restaurant so it is a convenient location": "positive", "Saku is one of my go tos if I'm looking for fancier sushi but at a reasonable price. They have an extensive menu including special rolls, torched & pressed sushi, a selection of combos and lunch specials! I ordered through Ubereats for my latest visit. Decided to order the assorted aburi sushi, saku roll, and lion king roll (all of which I've ordered before and loved). The aburi sushi was great as always. \u00a0Unfortunately this time I was quite disappointed with the rolls. The Saku roll was very mushy & had no flavours. I really hope this is just a one-time miss & their quality goes back to how it used to be": "positive", "Delicious all around! I wanted to try something other than rolls and was very impressed with my choice of Korean spicy chicken and sweet & spicy cauliflower. Both were delicious, & good price/portion! We started off our meal with the gyoza and they were great too! Would definitely come back here! My partner liked the rolls that we ordered. Also our server was super friendly and we came on a night that it rained and she was sooo friendly despite getting rained on": "positive", "Disappointed in this place.It used to be one of my go-tos a year or so back. I wanted to retry this place as I was looking for good sushi in the city. However, the sushi was not as fresh nor good as I have remembered it. And honestly- the price was way too expensive for what we got. Should have gone to Miku instead for the price": "positive", "They had their order/pickup station set up in the front door for covid reasons during my visit and the menu displayed in the front window.I had the brisket sandwich with caramelized onions sauced with bbq and dijon mustard.Brisket was well seasoned and very tender. \u00a0Sauces complimented the rich fattiness of the meat.Definitely my new go to spot for hot sandwiches. Looking forward to try the steak sandwich next time I'm around": "positive", "Decent, but I don't get the hype.Clearly solid ingredients well made, tho bread was \u00a0not stellar, but honestly, to my palette, I was not blown away.Yet, Toronto loves lines and this place provides. Prepare to line up and wait.Not bad, just I don't get they hype": "positive", "I'm not sure if this place is under new ownership, but the quality and quantity of my last sandwich (beef brisket) was way lower than I expected. There was much less meat in the sandwich than I have ever had before. It tasted fine, but I won't be going back until things change. PS. To the earlier reviewer. Toronto loves lines? That's dumb": "positive", "I got the beef brisket sandwich. Super packed with flavour. However, the buns were damp from condensation in the packaging by the time we started eating (which was maybe 5 min after getting the sandwiches). Sandwich looked squished and was very greasy and messy. Overall...not the best experience. This was made worse since we were eating in the car (we figured we should just eat ASAP rather than wait to get home). It was like eating a sandwich that was trying to live up to the restaurant's reputation of being flavourful and really good, but sadly wasn't making the cut. Lots of sauce dribbling off from the insides though miraculously the beef brisket itself didn't fall out (which was good). My fingers still had sauce on them after wiping off the mess with a napkin and two wet wipes. Despite the somewhat disappointing experience, I'm willing to give this place another chance. Definitely going to get a different order - something that won't be as squishy or messy": "positive", "Great place for a tasty sandwich, you can choose your own flavours but any combination ends up being pretty tasty as the meat and vegetables are fresh and tasty": "positive", "Excellent sandwiches. \u00a0Quality ingredients and some of the best tasting sauces I've ever had": "positive", "I have been dreaming of going back to Black camel to eat their beef brisket sandwich again.This sandwich is da-bomb!!!!I had gone here just before they were closing and it was raining too.The place was empty and I did get to chat with the girl behind the counter-I asked her for her suggestion and without taking any time she recommended the beef brisket sandwich.So you build your sandwich-the process is quite uncomplicated-you pick a meat, your sauces and toppings.After the first or second topping they charge you for for additional topping pls check the menu.My order was the brisket wIth charamoula mayo topped with carmalized onions and coleslaw.I took it to go.I took my first bite in the car and boy oh boy the beef just melted in my mouth the flavors were on point and the quality of meat was amazing.The sauce did full justice plus the toppings.Eating the sandwich in the car was not a great idea \u00a0as it can become very messy \u00a0but I could g hold off since it was amazingly good and it would totally get soggy if I had waited.The best thing about it was the less sodium used in the beef brisket-felt like I was eating a homemade beef brisket sandwich.Parking could be a challenge here": "positive", "Solid sandwiches with very high quality ingredients! Excellent service - fast and friendly!": "positive", "Few weeks back I stopped in to Black Camel for Lunch. I have heard from a few friends that the sandwiches here are to die for. I opted to try the Slow Roasted Beef Brisket Sandwich. This was no small sandwich. The size was bigger than I expected for the price. Only $8.75 and you had a large kaiser roll full of tender goodness. You got a choice of two sauces and I went with the in house Black Camel BBQ sauce and the Chiptole Mayo. The meat was super tender and melted in your mouth. Paired with the two sauces made it slightly messy but well worth it. I will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches on the menu. If your near Rosedale station and are hungry stop in at Black Camel you won't be disappointed": "positive", "A great sandwich shop that has a killer bbq sauce. While this is another fine eatery where one might point out that my refusal to eat red meat makes my opinion less than, I'd argue that since there are only a couple things on the menu that I can eat, an endorsement from me is even better. Anyways, I hear the brisket is to die for but I've only ever had the chicken and while it's not death worthy it certainly is a great fucking sandwich and I'd suggest you pop in and grab a bite here. If you picked one up and started eating it while walking south on Yonge, you could finish it before hitting Bloor and then stop for a pint somewhere. Plus with their huge buns you'd have a nice base and be able to consume more booze. So win-win ya know": "positive", "The service was wonderful! There was a 30 min wait for patio seating. The hostess suggested us to go chill at the park until our table is ready. They couldn't contact me, so the hostess walked all the way to the park to let us know our table will be ready in 5 minute. THANK YOU! What we ordered: Roasted bone marrowGrill octopus Prosciutto ( Jamon iberico de bellota) Grilled picanha steak The food was amazing! I will definitely come back when I visit Toronto again": "positive", "I have heard of this place for several years, but only had a chance to try their takeout food recently. The portion was relatively small and pricy, but with decent quality of food provided with some highlights there. Their bakeries and cold dishes were especially amazing.My favourite dishes from the order:- Sourdough loaf: Why is the bread dish worth mentioning? Because it was bigger than my face and so chewy and flavourful.- Basque cake: They provided us with clear heat-at-home instructions and it tasted soooo delicious and not overwhelming me with its sweetness level. I wished the portion was slightly larger though because we couldn't have enough.- Mixed plate 4 pack: This included two types of cheese and sausage. Both sausages were so delicious and were gone in ten minutes. The Mountain oak Gouda cheese (cow cheese) was my personal favorite, with slightly stronger than medium flavour. My husband preferred the lighter Manchego cheese (sheep cheese). The cheese goes really well with the sourdough loaf. Worth a try.Now some hot dishes:- Charred octopus: We are a fan of octopus, so would almost order octopus dish everywhere we can. This was overall an average dish. The sauce was really good but the octopus was too hard. I would recommend dipping the sauce with the sourdough loaf though.- Asparagus salad: It was cooked well with its highlights being the strong scent of the Marcona almonds. This was a good dish but not wowing me.In general, I would like to revisit this place when they are reopening for dining in": "positive", "Food is delicious even tho it's on the more pricy side, we really liked the grilled octopus. The downside is the fixed 20% tip, especially they charge the tax on top of the tip which makes no sense to me": "positive", "Amazingggggg Tapas here. The standouts were the Shrimp, Snow pea leaves, and the Mushrooms!!! THE MUSHROOMS...Absolute flavour bombs and crispy. \u00a0I highly recommending ordering their classic bread and olive oil too, it was nice together BUT even better if you use the bread to dip with the Shrimp dish's sauces and chili oil!! Other notable tapas we tried was the Ceviche. It was almost like a guac but the fish was plentiful and fresh with the in house chips (seasoned with paprika too!). The Tomato bread was alright.Atmosphere felt super European. Especially since we came during the COVID outdoor patio season, their street side tiny tables for 2 set up was very minimal and Chic. It was a pricey meal but a lovely treat once in a while": "positive", "This spot is definitely the best Spanish restaurant in Toronto!My absolute favourites include: The shaved foie gras on a baguette. So rich, buttery and full of flavour! The octopus, which is their most popular dish, is always cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The iberico chorizo is also amazing, bite sized and so buttery it melts in your mouth Cozy vibe, great food and attentive service! What more could you ask for!": "positive", "Came here for Valentine's day dinner with my boyfriend. Let's just say this place was on my list of restaurants I wanted to try since time. I'm a huge fan of Grant van Gameren. The vibe outside reminds me of a tavern you'd come across in the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona. Inside is just as romantic with dim red mood lighting. It's very romantic. We chose to do the set menu however, we didn't realize how much food was coming out. We weren't that hungry but we said what the heck. We told them we just definitely wanted to try the Octopus (pulpo is my favourite!).First course was the charcuterie and cheese with bread - I wasn't a huge fan of smoked meat or meat that looks raw but I gave it a chance and it went well with the cheese. Second course was the shishito peppers - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish as I've had really delicious shishito peppers in Madrid and this couldn't compare. I wish it was a bit more charred and crispy.Third course was the Sweetbread and raw tuna - two things that I normally do not eat but I wanted to be adventurous and sucked it up. This dish was surprisingly really tasty with great contrasting textures. The less you think about what sweetbreads are the better it began to taste haha..Fourth course was the ceviche - another dish that i normally do not eat since I generally don't eat raw fish but the flavours here were done very well and the fish was fried so crispy and used as a bowl to house the ceviche which i thought was very clever. By this course we were so full that we couldn't finish the ceviche. We also didn't finish the first course too.Fifth course was the octopus - I feel bad saying this but perhaps it was my high expectations but I had better octopus at Ricardo's. However, it was still very tasty though.Sixth course was the mushrooms - omg to die for. I can't believe after all these courses the mushrooms took the cake! It was the best mushrooms I've ever had. I would go back just for the mushrooms (not even for the octopus!) which speaks volumes.We ended off our night with the dessert courses...Seventh course - THE BASQUE CAKE - probably one of the simplest but most scrumptious desserts I've ever had. Would also come back just for the basque cake. Eighth and last course - ice cream bars covered in chocolate. This was basically like a tiny mini version of a Klondike bar. I wasn't impressed. Overall, I don't know if it was just a mix of my high expectations and the fact that I decided to be adventurous and got that basically handed to me with everything I don't usually eat. But I feel like I've had a better experience with a tasting menu at DaiLo but I gave it a try and the food here was really well done. That, paired with the vibes of this place, it's so romantic and a perfect date spot. However, quite pricey and be ready to spend a couple hundred dollars especially if you're ordered drinks (which we did)": "positive", "I finally got a chance to try the infamous Bar Isabel (took me a while)! I made reservations for a Saturday night knowing that it was going to be slammed and boy, did it get packed the later it got!The restaurant wasn't as packed as I thought it would be but boy, was it dim in there? I'm not those diners who would turn on their phone flash light to read the menu but I wouldn't blame you if we did. The menu was pretty much entirely in Spanish but there were definitely a few winners. The Roasted Bone Marrow - Creamy, fatty and delicious. They do it so well here and I know they have this in most restaurants but get it here as well.Shrimp al Ajillo - This was the highlight of my meal actually, not the Grilled Octopus. The shrimp that they used were the giant red shrimps from Argentina so they were very meaty and juicy. I had my first one in La Banane and was mind-blown. These were cooked in a rich butter garlic sauce, and yes they were amazing.Basque Cake - I would come back just for this. You simply cannot go for a meal a Bar Isabel and not order the Basque Cake. It was like a cookie scented cake bathed in a thick and creamy sherry sauce. It may not look photogenic but ORDER IT": "positive", "Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. Their market is also great and we love stopping by to buy their bread. They also have a cute tapas box to go. If you can, try to treat yourself here at least once!": "positive", "Had an absolutely wonderful dinner here recently. We were seated away from the crowd so it was lovely quiet relaxed experience. Started with the Flat Earth cocktail which was delicious while being mostly a savoury drink. It was well balanced and mixed so it did not feel too heavy or strange. For food, we had the bread, oysters, octopus, tuna mojama, half service of the jamon tasting, veal sweetbreads and raw tuna, and chorizo verde. Every single dish had its unique flavours and textures which complimented each other while bringing different experiences to the table. A table favorite was the sweetbreads because every flavour and texture could be found on a single dish. The chorizo verde was so tender, full of herbs and is the first ever sausage I would describe as light. The octopus was perfectly tender. The butter sauce that it came with was too salty for my tastes, but it went well with the hearty sour bread. Absolutely lovely meal!! Definitely a great treat!!": "positive", "The service we received here recently was abysmal, which is unfortunate because I was really forward to trying this restaurant out . We were going to order food but the off-putting service encouraged us to wrap up here after a few drinks, which were not that great to begin with, and move along to another cocktail bar nearby": "positive", "Amazing banh mi!! I was starving but also, I think I can probably live on this everyday Little shop at the intersection. Close to college park where you can eat. Indoor dining area isn't big -- maybe 3-4 tables?Would recommend if you want some reasonably healthy but still juicy and good lunch options ~": "positive", "This place is a Vietnamese fusion to go banh mi joint. I got the pork and my husband got the chicken (both extra spicy which means sriracha and fresh jalape\u00f1os...the jalape\u00f1os were actually spicy!). Service is fast and the sandwiches are large. They have a great selection of drinks. I got the Mr. coffee and my hubby got a san Pellegrino. I thought the banh mis were fine and got the job done for a quick lunch. We did get a octopus taco, which was not good or fresh. So, I would stick to meats if you go here. To be fair, I don't love fusion food and it looked like other customers got the baos (so maybe those are better?)": "positive", "First time trying first time trying this location. It's as good as the Queen street and Spadina location. \u00a0Had the grilled pork banh mi and it did not disappoint. \u00a0Ordered it spicy (with jalape\u00f1o) and found that it could have been more spicy but still tasty nonetheless. Ordered regular fries and it was enough to share for two people. \u00a0Would definitely be back again": "positive", "A nice stroll at the heart of yonge dundas one will see this amazing restaurant. It's a very nice, quiet, and serene place. Would love to come again": "positive", "This spot is in the middle of everything yet hard to find maybe due to it's black colored board. We ordered 4 Fried Chicken steamed baos 2 Hot- Jalape\u00f1os which tasted sweet and 2 Medium hot - sriracha sauce was ok but a little more sauce would have been perfect. If you like hot and spicy stuff like south asian people my recommendation is to go with medium hot - sriracha sauce and ask them to double the sauce and viol\u00e0...Can't complaint about the chicken as it was so tender and crispy to perfection. Best thing about Bahn Mi Boys Baos are they all come with some sort of veggies which gives them a healthy touch": "positive", "My friend and I always come here for a quick bite. We love how they have options for vegetarians! My friend will always get the lemongrass tofu banh mi & this time I got the kalbi beef banh mi. We also shared the tofu fries. All were good as always! Very consistent with their food": "positive", "That 5 spice pork meat and the fried chicken meat are BOMB!! They have a variety of other meats I wish I got the chance to try- all range from $7 or so for the banh mis, which is pricier but worth the taste. Mayo adds to hold both the banh mi and the bao together. I think the meat is really what makes it no matter what you get. Got it to go because they close at 10pm, went there around 9:37pm and they were closing up. See pics for menu": "positive", "Thank god for Banh Mi Boys.I come here once a week for lunch. The place is a little dirty as most of the staff is behind the counter and lunch time gets hectic.My favorites to order:1. Deep-fried Chicken Bao: finally, I can enjoy a bao without pork! The sauces here are similar to a banh mi but not quite. The veggies they use are delicious and really add to the flavor. The bao is always soft and warm. Very filling.2. Sweet Potato Fries: The portions are huge. The fries always seem a little burnt but still good. A little oily but crispy.These 2 things fill me up for under $10. TIP: Order on Ritual!": "positive", "Service is fast and food is always pretty consistent. Love their kimchi fries and baos. Their kimchi fries are better than the ones from H-Mart": "positive", "Banh Mi Boys is one of my fav places to grab a quick bite with friends, they even have some awesome vegetarian options. I have probably visited this location over a dozen times, and they never disappoint. The staff here are always great, and they are fast even when the place is packed! There is maybe about 8 tables to sit-down at, so be prepared to grab take-out if there isn't any seats. I've tried their Banh Mi sandwiches, Baos and Tacos and they are all so delectable! The Duck Confit Banh Mi sandwich is probably my favourite, with the 5 Spice Pork Belly Bao following shortly behind. And I would recommend ALWAYS order the Kimchi Fries! They are probably the best side you could ever ask for. So if you're ever in the area and want a good quick bite that you won't hate yourself for, skip the McDonald's and walk down to Banh Mi Boys!": "positive", "A great late night spot for snacks and drinks! I had a reservation for four, late on a Saturday night. I really enjoyed their Lychee Mojito cocktails, and I put in numerous Salmon Oshizushi orders. I think the best sharing snacks though were the okonomiyaki pancake and takoyaki, both of those orders were well loved by our table. Service was good, our waitress definitely gave our table some space and time between orders, and we didn't feel rushed or timed during our stay. Kinka Izakaya is a fantastic spot for post-pandemic catch-up and drinks, and I highly recommend them for large groups or parties!": "positive", "I'm not sure how to rate this. 4/5 stars pre-COVID because everything I ordered was amazing and the menu selection was huge. But I came once indoor dining was open and the menu was considerably condensed. The explanation was a lot of the items were not in season (like the baked oyster with cheese, almond tofu dessert). And a lot of my favourite items weren't there. I guess with COVID, ingredient prices have gone up but I feel like the whole reason I enjoyed kinka in the past was the wide variety of flavourful items. Anyways, today we ordered the ebimayo deep fried shrimp, takoyaki, takowasabi, karaage, salmon & scallop pressed sushi, special items menu. Things I'd order again: takowasabi - strong wasabi flavour and a classic nose punch burn. Very flavourful. Yummy). \u00a0Aburi buta bara (grilled pork belly with garlic sauce) - nice smoky bbq taste. Good flavour. Tokyo fry (French fries with garlic mayo)- mc Donald's like French fries. Tasty. Nama grapefruit cocktail- you get to squeeze your own grapefruit. Picturesque. Tasty!Things that coasted in the middle:Salmon oshizushi (blow torched pressed salmon sushi)- salmon was tasty but the rice a little too mushy but held it's shape. Things I wouldn't order again:salmon nattoyukke (salmon sashimi/seaweed/onsen tamago)- the lightly cooked sunny side up egg mixed with the salmon sashimi seaweed salad just didn't suit my taste buds at all. I found it very unappealingly bland. My least favorite dish of the night. Kamo tataki (sous vide duck breast)- okay taste but dry. Hotate oshizushi (pressed scallop sushi)- bland Karaage - nothing special. Ebi mayo - all I could taste was fried batter doused in mayo. And I'm sad because I swear this used to be one of my favourites. Batter was quite thick. Takoyaki- good texture but the sauce was overly ketchup-y. Overpowered the overall taste. My server was nice and I enjoy whenever they greet you upon entry. I look forward to the day they bring back their usual menu that I loved so much. I'll update my review then": "positive", "Sooooo good. Great atmosphere, food taste good.. the gin sonic is to die for. Watch out, that drink will sneak up in you! I will definitely be going back": "positive", "We ordered Uber eats for their 3 course meal as their website was down and not accepting my credit card :( The food and portions at their locations are excellent - they definitely hold the same standard of service. I really appreciated them punching holes into the Karaage box so steam can escape and reduce chances of sogginess. The pieces of chicken were large and lightly battered. A lemon wedge to reduce the oiliness also came along the mayo dip. Their bentos are really filling and has a good variety of meats, and side dishes including tamagoyaki, bamboo shoots, tomato, spinach. I genuinely hope that Kinka stays afloat as I'd love to celebrate another exciting and lively birthday/drinking session with friends. Definitely missing the izakaya atmosphere": "positive", "Lively spot for drinks and tapas. Love the gong haha. Food is good and the vibe is fun": "positive", "I used to like this place because of the Japanese vibes, good service and a variety of food menus.I know we're in difficult situation, however the menu was too simplified and no more interesting menus. The servers never checked on us, giving us kind of attitudes, never say thank you when we were leaving(the serevers were just chatting). The Japanese servers were all gone and I did not feel like this is the same place I used to come": "positive", "Very cool place to hangout with friends. The food quality is very good. It is a loud place and if you want to have a convo it is not a good choice haha": "positive", "Usually come here for group dinner, the place gets super loud but the food and drink varieties are good. My favourite go-to dishes are Kakimayo (baked oyster) and Ebimayo (deep fried prawns).I highly recommend the mix-and-match lunch set. For $15, you get to pick your own salad, appetizer, side dish, main dish, and it comes with a soup. The food is delicious, the selection is great, service is faster and the ambiance is much quieter than dinner time.Bonus: If you post a pic on IG with hashtags \u00a0#kinkaizakayato and #kinkaizakayabloor, and show your server, you'll get free ice cream": "positive", "I have been to Kinka Izakaya a few times over the years, and have always enjoyed my dining experience here. Instead of ala-carte, I tried the Kinkalicious menu last week. It's their take on the long-running Summerlicious, where they offer a set course meal for an affordable price. It's a great way to sample the menu without breaking the bank.The 8-course menu offers a range of popular dishes that can be shared among friends and is only $29 per person (minimum of 2 people). If you're not into a tasting menu, then you will find that the menu offers a variety of traditional and modern specialties made for sharing.Course #1 - \u00a0We started our meal off with the Gomaee, which was blanched rapini in black sesame sauce. The black sesame sauce really added a nice kick to the veggie dish.  Course #2 - The second course was the Sashimi Platter. It was beautifully plated and came with a variety of fresh fish. Thickly cut too! Course #3 - Gyu Shabu SaladCourse #4 - The third course was the Angus Beef Yukke, which was angus beef tartare topped with scallion, raw quail egg yolk, and nori. It was a dish that I would never order as I don't eat raw beef, but my friend really enjoyed it. Course #5 - The Fry Platter was my absolute favorite of the night! It consisted of the three items that I always order whenever I am at a Kinka Family establishment including Kinton Ramen. Their gyoza is one of the best I've ever had, especially with the accompanying sauce. The takoyaki was plump and wasn't overly battered.Course #6 - The Kakimayo is very popular amongst diners. It's baked oysters with spinach, mushrooms, garlic mayo and cheese. A deadly (if you're lactose intolerant), but a yummy combination.Course #7 - Next up before dessert was the Kinoko Bibimbap, which is a hot stone with rice, mushrooms, cheese, and seaweed sauce. It's a vegetarian dish, and you can mix it yourself or ask one of the servers. This dish was really good!Course #8 - We ended the night off with a scoop of Matcha Ice-Cream. Nothing special, but good. Kinka Izakaya also offers an everyday set menu with 10 courses for $35 per person. Overall, Kinka Izakaya is a very solid izakaya option in Toronto. However, I would not recommend going there if you have an aversion to loud sounds, or headache, as its atmosphere is very lively": "positive", "I came here with a group of friends mainly for their kinkalicious $29.99 set meal special and was slightly disappointed for a number of reasons: 1. The noise. I've been to the Yonge location before and thought it was a good level of excitement. I did see a lot of the warning reviews for this location but wasn't expecting that level of noise. It's not a good exciting type of noise, but the kind where you have to yell to talk and constantly repeat yourself. It gets super loud with the sake bombs- it's only (kinda) nice when you're the ones doing them. They shake these tin sounding things and it pierces your ears. 2. The service was not impressive. We had to ask our server for refills of water. Also, after the 6th course she asked if we were ready for dessert before we received our bibimbap. After we asked about it, she told us that the kinkalicious doesn't come with the bibimbap, as it only applies to their regular set meal. We pulled out the menu and showed her. I don't get how a server can't know their own menu to that extent, especially when the kinkalicious is such a huge special going on. Had we just took her word for it, we would have been skimped out on the most filling dish... 3. They ran out of matcha ice cream. We were finishing off our dinner around 9.. maybe that's a bit late but when any restaurant runs out of a main component it def doesn't impress me. Especially when they have a special going on, they should prepare and overstock to ensure there will be more than enough to meet demand. 4. They didn't allow us to split bills... just the full bill for the table. This is super inconvenient when you're coming in a group, let alone a large group. 5. For the set meal, they don't serve the dishes individually. They bring you dishes and say \"this serves 2/3\" and you have to figure out how to divvy it up yourselves. This isn't ideal unless you have a s/o to partner up with... considering you're paying an individual price per person, it would be nice to get individual portions. Those unimpressive points aside, the food was okay. The set meal is a cool experience because you get to try things you might not normally try. Izakaya foods are typically on the pricier size for the portions you get... but personally I wouldn't pay the normal $35/person for the set meal, as I was still kind of hungry after. Overall, I much prefer the Yonge location because the atmosphere and noise level is more reasonable there": "positive", "My partner's friend told us about this and I was like ok. It looks awesome... then we went there since we had a reservation. It's a lot of people going there as it's well known for lobsters and dung crabs. I saw how huge lobster is and I was like o m g!!! They let me hold it for the picture. Awesome!!!Then they deliver food and these food are damn good!!! Pardon my language but you can see why how tastes so good!!!I would recommend anyone who loveeeee lobsters and crabs then go there!!! High recommend to make reservation in advance!": "positive", "The service was great! The king crab and lobster were very fresh! However, i find the cooking style and the overall taste is heavier than my liking. It's very Cantonese. The sweet glaze over the oyster was good but too much it's like eating desert. The king crab leg were good but over garlicky. I will go back again, but will request for less seasoning": "positive", "I feel like Fishman Lobster CLubhouse is a place to go if you want the experience like no other (Ie having a grand show and just want to impress the family/friend thats never been). For the price, the lobster quality is decent and will be worth every now and then. I think if you come here, you are also paying for that presentation. Otherwise, the food when I went a couple times was well balanced, flavours are reminiscent of the asian profiles of garlic, black bean, five spice etc. I personally prefer steamed over stir fried seafood, but they do it nice and the lobsters are not rubbery when cooked. Other than the seafood, the way they stirfry other dishes, including rice and vegetables are nice and good in consistency. Overall a good place for a family feast or friend gathering. Again, not something to eat everyday as price does add up, and it depends on how big/ weight your seafood is, so be careful with your budget!": "positive", "What an amazing place!! This was on my list as a \"must try\" when I was in Toronto. \u00a0I made reservation for early afternoon on a weekday. \u00a0When I first got there, they could not find my reservation, but it was not peak time, so it was not as busy, so they seated me right away. \u00a0The restaurant itself was huge and it was really nice inside. \u00a0There are lobster tanks all around the restaurant. \u00a0I wanted to try both the lobster tower (which was the reason why I wanted to come to Fishman) and the crab. \u00a0The waitress suggested that I get the combo, which had a few other items. \u00a0It was a way better deal to do this, so I decided on this option.The food came out relatively quickly and OMG, it was so delicious:1. Corn soup - It was pretty chilly that day, so the soup was really good as an appetizer. 2. Lobster Tower - I got the HK style lobster tower. \u00a0I thought this would be a let down, but it exceeded my expectation. \u00a0The lobster was fresh and the seasoning was so good! The fries made it a nice touch to eat with the lobster. 3. Crab tower - Not as voluminous as the lobster tower, but also one of my favorite dishes. \u00a0I really enjoyed the sauce on the crab and it was super easy to eat. 4. Garlic crab - This was probably my least favorite of the combo. \u00a0I thought that the garlic sauce was a little bland.5. Crab Fried Rice - Really good rice and plenty of crab in the riceThis combo also came with a veggie, but I was too full to try any. \u00a0The veggie came out last, so I was pretty full by then. \u00a0Just writing this review makes me crave the food again. \u00a0I am definitely putting this on my must try when I am in Toronto again": "positive", "Came here with my family to celebrate. We got the lunch set for 3. It came with a corn soup, stir fried beef, deep fried oysters, fried rice with lobster, stir fried veggies, the infamous lobster tower (4lbs) and macarons for dessert.I was surprised by the quality of the seafood, the oysters were huge and you can tell the lobster is very fresh. The flavour of all the dishes were very well done! Especially the egg yolk lobster, I recommend everyone who is a fan of lobster to try it :) The total came to around $240 after tax and tips, I would say this was great value for your money": "positive", "After seeing this place in sooo many Youtube videos, it was a must when in Toronto. Of course I tried the lobster mountain. Let me tell you that thing is not a joke. We ordered 35lbs of lobster and divided them into two flavors/cooking style: Hong Kong style and Maggi. Losbter 1 - 0 Us. We were defeated after that meal. There was so much leftover (I think 25lbs would have been perfect for 10-12 people) as the meal set comes with sides (veggies, sweet and sour pork, soup, and we switched the wine for the fried rice). Both, the Hong Kong style and the Maggi were good. I liked the texture of the Hong Kong Style as it was fried and came with french fries but I liked the taste of the Maggi one more. The service was lacking a bit, took them a while to change our plates. Overall, food was good, but service was so so. I would recommend this place if you are really craving or love lobster!": "positive", "This was our 3rd time at this Chinese Seafood institution in Scarborough. My brother reserved a table for us at 7:30pm. The restaurant has a very opulent atmosphere and there are fish tanks surrounding the dining area with fresh live king crabs, lobsters and fish.The menus are place mat style listed on paper. You have the option to order a set dinner or you can order a la carte.We ordered the dinner for 4 which included King Crab with 3 courses: 1. \u00a0Fried crab legs with Maggi sauce2. Steamed crab body with egg whites3. Fried rice in crab shell5 lb HK style lobster tower served with garlic bits and french friesSnow pea leaves with Goji berriesThere was a pork bone soup served as the starter. The stir fried crab legs were seasoned well and a bit on the salty side. However the steamed crab with egg white balanced things out. The crab shell was served in a fried rice. Kudos to the chef.The HK lobster was served in a massive tower assembled with precison and \u00a0topped with spicy French fries which is a first. My last visit there it was served with lots of fried garlic chips. We still enjoyed the lobster however I prefer the large garlic chips!Poached Snow pea leaves with goji berries provided some greens to balance out the protein buster meal.Overall decent experience. \u00a0I would like the servers to provide more attentive service to all tables. It seemed hard to flag down a server to change our plates and refill our tea pot. This place is great for a family celebration or company party. Make sure you come hungry": "positive", "I always go to the Fishman Lobster when I'm craving lobster and when\u00a0my mom has time to take me there, and you know what? They were the catalysts for my love of seafood. I'd never touched a crab or lobster until Fishman Lobster, but they'd definitely helped me to broaden my horizons.I love the Hong Kong-style lobsters, and eating them with the gloves they provide is a lot of fun.The pricing is also fairly affordable, since with the lobsters and the amount you're paying for, you get\u00a0additional meals like soup, veggies, deep fried oysters, fried rice, and so on.There is also a complimentary dessert at the end where they offer macarons, which may be a little disappointing at times, but that isn't really my main concern really.This restaurant is ideal for family reunions, school reunions, or just for anybody who craves lobster.Overall, I'll return to this place anytime I have a craving for lobster, as I have for the previous years": "positive", "My family and I have been coming to Fishman for years and I'm finally able to leave a review!Needless to say, we love Fishman to the point that we are willing to drive over an hour to eat here. The food is exquisitely plated and incredibly flavorful! When you first walk in you notice the tanks of crab and lobster that the line the walls and that giant neon lobster sign. The whole restaurant seems pretty clean with a classy industrial feel.My family ordered 1 large crab with 3 lobsters. The staff brought them out for us to take pictures and examine the specimen. I thought this was a fun experience to see what we were eating up close! They then proceeded to prepare them into different dishes.Our first dish was the crab leg tower where they had taken the crab legs, fried them, and coated them with a savory sauce. They may have been double fried but it was so delicious! They even cut open the legs so that they'd be easier to eat. The table had a box of gloves we could use in case we didn't want to get our hands dirty.Our second dish was almost like a lobster mountain! The picture I have does not do the dish justice since this was quite literally a massive pile of lightly fried lobster. Everything was so tender and juicy. And not only that, but it was also prepared in a way that was easy to eat. We also had a couple other dishes that were still just as amazing using the remnants of the crab and lobster. Nothing goes to waste!Overall, I'm blown away every time I come here. Though it's a bit expensive, I highly encourage others to stop by to experience the incredible food. And bring friends! You won't be able to finish this on your own! ;)": "positive", "Lobster HK Style Dinner for 3-4 $168+Soup of the Day+Lobster HK style (4lbs)+Steamed bass 1.5 Lbs+Poached Snow pea leaves +Lobster Roe Fried Rice+DessertAdded 1.3 pounds of lobster ($22/pound)Fried E Fu Noodles $16Diced Beef Tenderloin $25Total including tax and tip was just under $300All the food is very good... my favourite is the lobster but the beef is also legit good (soft/flavourful/tender).. only thing mediocre is the macarons but I mean my kids enjoyed it. Wish they still did the sweet red bean dessert to wrap up a traditional Chinese dinner and it would be perfectAmbience is quite nice, feels lux, well lite open space allowing for gathering of all sizes. Love the cute wooden barrels surrounding the restaurant as decor and as a table topCan't say there seems to be a designated waiter or waitress assigned to your table but when you flag them they are eager to come help you and attend to your needs quite quicklyThey don't give you all the required utensils upfront so you will need to ask i.e spoons for rice or any forks.. you are only given chopsticksTips:+Reservations definitely recommend as they get quite busy+Use double the gloves so it doesn't seep through+ You can take pictures with your seafood before it gets cookedOnly thing is I wish they automatically gave you wet wipes but that's not an offering": "positive", "The world famous Apple Cake I remember trying this almost a decade ago and I couldn't believe how delicious it was. It's still as good today, moist on the inside with some hints of crispy edges. So friggin good. Do yourself a favour and just buy a full or half slab of it because one slice won't be enough!": "positive", "Mystic Muffin is an absolute staple of Downtown Toronto. Whenever I have friends from abroad come visit and we're just a little bit hungover, I make sure to work Mystic Muffin into the conversation.A friend of mine recently moved into the Queen/Sherbourne area and I made sure to take her directly to Elias. The owner of MM, Elias, couldn't be more friendly. He works diligently and efficiently, but makes sure that you're well taken care of during your visit.Aside from the traditional breakfast fare, I'd definitely try the apple cake. Think of it as the Baked Apple Pie from McDonald's... but way better. It's usually hot and fresh, and has just the right combination of sweet, savoury, and tart. For $4, it can't be beat.Mystic Muffin is one of the best known places for breakfast in Toronto and for good reason. Great selection, great food, and most of all, great service. You can't go wrong paying Elias a visit next time you're in the Queen/Jarvis area!": "positive", "SO HAPPY I FINALLY TRIED THIS TORONTO STAPLE. Their signature apple cake is a MUST. So moist but still had a caramelized crust. Their croissant was surprisingly very fresh and their muffins wasn't too sweet at all, just the right touch (infinitely better than your local Tim's muffins)!": "positive", "Incredibly good value! Just had the sausage rolls and and spicy beef patty! Amazing! Friendly service with all kinds of delicious offerings!": "positive", "I was moseying around for my morning walks and figured I'd go see if Mystic Muffin was open. Not only are they open but they are ready to serve!There is a lot more room to wait inside as they cleared away the tables and chairs to the corner. The store is still homey with lots of pastries, patties, and ready-to-make wraps at your service. The food is literally always, always fresh.The owner is the sweetest man ever. He's always ready to joke around and have a conversation with you.I bought half an apple cake today for $11 (full one is $20) and these things are massive!Definitely drop by if you're in the area": "positive", "The apple cake was delicious (I bought half the cake) :). \u00a0The banana bread with chocolate chips was also a 2 thumbs up and the sausage rolls were quite yummy as well. I will be going back to try some more items from the menu. \u00a0The owner was so friendly": "positive", "What can I say, I have a soft spot for mom and pop shops that provide good food at a fair price and Mystic Muffin is definitely it.Their platter, while possibly to carb heavy for some, is so flavourful, especially the potatoes and portions are very generous. I particularly recommend their eggplant, which, though it costs extra, is worth every penny.Though not pictured, I also indulged in Mystic's famous apple cake---a delicious treat that's got a bit of crunch up top but is perfectly moist everywhere else. So delicious I got half a pan of it ($11) to share at work and nobody could stop at just having a slice.I look forward to trying more menu items and knowing where I can go for delicious and fairly priced cakes for potlucks and gatherings!": "positive", "Amazing apple pie! Best apple pie I ever had. The owner is very friendly. Just fyi, credit card might not be accepted but debit card is. Price is reasonable too. Thank you Mystic muffin for making my day!": "positive", "I wouldn't say this is the \"best apple crumble in town\". \u00a0This is overrated, but still a decent apple pie. I ordered the pie with lentil soup. The soup is much better than the pie": "positive", "I looked online for nearby restaurants and Mystic Muffin showed up. It had a bunch of 5-star reviews and photos. Especially of their apple cake. So, I got ready and walked in the beautiful 70\u00b0 weather for the 1.4 miles. The owner, his wife, and little son were so hospitable. I wound up having the \u00a0falafel wrap, Mt. Dew, and a piece of that apple cake. I am here to tell you, it would have been worth the walk at 5 miles. (For me, that's saying something). By the way, I ordered two pieces of apple cake to go as well": "positive", "The Ravistew was awesome and I really liked the lamb wrap. Lots of meat!Thank you so much!": "positive", "You can't go wrong with the wraps for lunch! I've tried two wraps here when I was super busy at work and didn't have time to make food. They have a lot of flavours you'll definitely find one you'll like!": "positive", "This is a definite recommend place if you're in need of something warm on a cold day. Coming in, the cashier is very courteous and welcoming. The restaurant has a big spacious area inside if you want to dine in, or you can opt for the bar seats by the open window. They have a big selection of soups to choose from, and they offer combos with wraps/sandwiches. The food didn't take too long to arrive, roughly 10 mins. The portions were pretty big, which is great as the price of the combo was roughly $15. The mushroom soup had a very clean taste, and there was big chunks of mushrooms inside. It also had a hint \u00a0of truffle flavour which gave the soup a very fresh smell/flavour. Ravi's Stew is definitely perfect if you want something with a slight kick as the soul was very flavorful and packed vegetables. We got the combo with the butter chicken \u00a0wrap and wow, the wrap with stuffed which chicken. I was super full by the end, but I was very satisfied with what I ordered. Next time I'll probably get either the soup or wrap haha": "positive", "Even though the namesake of this place is soups, my favorite thing here is their curry lamb wrap. The lamb is cooked and marinated really well in the curry, which has a slight kick to it as well.The pork shoulder wrap was okay, but the pork needed more seasoning. The pineapple salsa helped bring it to life a little, but even a little salt would go a long way. If you get this, I'd pair it with a soup that has a more robust flavor.I'm glad that they are downtown, but it still makes me sad to see that covid restrictions mean both the interior and patio are empty of people and liveliness": "positive", "This spot is so close to our condo. So we decided to check it out! And it did not disappoint. We ordered the chicken and pork shoulder wraps & Ravi soup. The flavour is so profound and they did not cheap out on the portion. I was happily stuffed. 10/10 coming back": "positive", "The worst soup and wraps that I've ever had in my life... omg... the most blend taste of butternut squash soup. zero flavor and you only taste coconut milk.. when they make wraps, they touch the ingredients with bare hands and they used the unwashed pans.. I understand having fruit flies but just regular flies are unacceptable.... (I don't usually leave reviews on yelp, actually it's my first and will be the last review.)": "positive", "Value for money is definitely there! It's the perfect spot for a cold winter day as they have amazing wraps and soups on offer. Today I got the chicken wrap, no soup thought as I thought it would be too much for a weekday lunch. My Roasted Free Range Chicken wrap had roasted yams, baby spinach, edamame, caramelized onions, tomato chutney & chipotle mayo. The combination of the yams with onions was delicious! I really liked the chicken too - it tasted fresh out of the oven. I didn't care too much for the edamame myself but it didn't take away from the overall dish. I ended up packing half of the wrap as I don't know how anyone would have had a full wrap. It's quite filling and very delish! :)": "positive", "Full disclosure: this review is biased. Meaning: I am a soup person at my very core. I love soup. I can eat it for any meal. It's the thing that gets me through fall, winter, also spring. It is perfect and my love for it is pure and unabashed. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way - this place is great! The soups seem super fresh, and as I was skimming the menu I kept thinking how great the ingredients pairings are in each one. When it came time to order, I decided on butternut squash with pear and fried shallots, and it was packed with flavor! The portion was huge as well - that bowl means business. And that biscuit that's served with it - gahhh, yes! For $10, I feel you definitely get a full meal. /10, would absolutely go back": "positive", "This place make some delicious soup! I ordered for the first time through RITUAL and was pleasantly surprised.I ordered the Wrap & Soup Combo ($13.49) with the upgrade to Ravistew for a \u00a0$1.00Roasted Free Range Chicken (Mildly Spicy), Regular Wrap, White WrapWhile the soup was tasty and full of flavour, the wrap was just average for me, I think because it lacked textural contrast and spice. The roasted yams and \u00a0caramelized onions inside the wrap combined with the Chipotle Mayo made it pretty sweet. I would love the option to add something a bit more crunchy in the wrap like carrots or red peppers.I initially decided to try out this place because I was feeling a bit under the weather and needed some soothing soup to help me fight the onset of a cold. The \u00a0RaviStew was exactly what I pictured when I ordered it and it did not disappoint. While it did taste like a homemade goat or chicken curry, I didn't mind because that was exactly what I needed. Head up, the RaviStew has some tumeric in it , so stains can easily occur! Overall it was a pretty good first visit, the service was fast & friendly, and the portion size was so generous!": "positive", "I got the butternut squash soup and a roasted veggie wrap for a spontaneous lunch before a movie. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and they have free wifi which is always a nice commodity! They were very friendly when taking our order and the food was prepared quickly. The food itself was good, the soup was a little spicy from the pepper they used I think, but it was not unbearable as I enjoy spicy but it might catch others who don't like the extra spice off guard. The wrap was very large for the price and was loaded with lots of veggies. Would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again and craving a comforting soup!": "positive", "This is a review of their VIRTUAL MIXOLOGY event.What a treat! \u00a0So all the ingredients arrived a few days in advance of the event, very nicely packaged, recipe card including items needed for session.The mixologist (Hugh) was personable, very easy to follow and knowledgeable, provided right amount of time between steps and overall did a great job.The drinks we made were great and exotic enough but still approachable. Will definitely be using this for future team building sessions!Great job": "positive", "Cocktail menu was cute. Feels dark, intimate, and lounge like. The crowd was good- no loud kids being sloppy . Seating in the couches is much better in my IMO. Drinks didn't disappoint, had the sesame ______. Recommend going early to get a spot as they appeared busy and full. On arrival, they seated us almost right away and realized they situated the wrong table. We had menus ready to order when they asked us to move back to the waiting area/outside. Pretty embarrassing to do that from all the way in the back. Once we were re-seated the manager came and compted us some this smokey thing with spoons which was appreciated but also lied about the situation to make it seem as it was a misunderstanding and didn't mean to make us move but there's no confusion when you tell us to go back to wait. \u200d Nonetheless if I lived in the area I'd take my friends there for craft cocktails": "positive", "Probably one of the best cocktail bar experiences in the world. Toronto had some amazing places to visit, but for anyone who enjoys an experience, this is the place to be. A delightful and pricey experience with top notch service. They have small plates to share and all the bites are yummy. We ordered the Korean tofu, chicken Karaage and charred butter. For drinks we ordered - essence of fall, hickory Manhattan, pina colada, apricot. Totally worth it!": "positive", "Always wanted to try this place as they had such beautiful drinks. They don't take reservations so you have to put yourself on a wait list the day of. PUT YOURSELF ON THE WAITLIST!! I cannot emphasize that enough. I had booked for a table of 4 and they said the wait would be for around 1.5 hr and we still waited for 2.5 hr and there were people that tried to walk in and got turned away. Be prepared to wait, thankfully there's lots to do and walk around in that area, so grab an ice cream or even dinner while u wait. Service: 5/5 Amazing staff. We were given the wrong table (table of 2 when we were a 4 top) and they were very apologetic even though it really wasn't a big deal because we were seated right away shortly after. The manager came to our table and gave us complimentary drinks for the mistake which was so so nice of her. We also got a lot or recommendations for drinks and their staff are really knowledgeable in terms of menu knowledge and what we would like. Drinks 5/5It was art. The drinks were so beautiful and presented in a way that made it seem like art. The server explained what she was doing the whole time and how we should drink it and what it would taste like. It was pretty amazing and i personally loved the pina colada a lot paired with the ice cream. A sweet and tropical taste to it paired with rum ice cream. It was an amazing cocktail and experience. Food: 6/5We got some snacks and honestly their fried chicken was so so amazing. Definitely will come back just for it. We also got popcorn, it had a special seasoning to it, wasnt sure what it was but it was really tasty. Overall 5/5 Would definitely recommend this place for the experience. Their pricing is on the more expensive side but it's 100 percent worth it to get the artistic drinks in my opinion. Would come back for the great service, beautiful drinks and not to mention, fried chicken": "positive", "They are a first come first serve bar, but they use the Yelp wait list function which I always appreciate because you can join the line in advance and also be notified in real time. Loved the atmosphere here! Very intimate and made it feel like you were getting an exclusive experience. The staff was very welcoming without being overbearing.We sat at the bar and was able to watch the bar tenders in action.We ordered the Essence of Fall from their Modernist series, and it was truly a sensory experience. Highly recommend! Only thing was that where we were seated by the bar, it was very dark and therefore difficult to see the presentation of the drink. We had to use a phone flashlight discretely to see our drink": "positive", "Cozy place and was great for date nights. Drinks were so pretty, the alcohol was on the stronger end tho": "positive", "Such a sublime little spot! My boyfriend took me to BarChef during my recent Toronto visit after telling me about it for months! This small, dark, intimate cocktail bar looks more like an apothecary & serves fantastical cocktails! While a bit hard to read in the dimly lit bar, we chose one drink from each of the 3 categories (minus Absinthe series): Overture, Parfumerie & Modernist. Such an experience! Loved it & looking forward to being back to try other cocktails": "positive", "Very unique bar experience. The drinks are something you don't normally get from a pub": "positive", "I don't know why I gave this place only 4 stars originally. Pretty awesome place and deserves 5!": "positive", "The coolest bar I have ever been to. I went here on my trip to Toronto and recommend it to any other tourists. I got the gin and elderflower cocktail which came with black truffle foam and coconut snow. It had a unique and exciting flavor and was truly a culinary experience. Every drink that we saw on other tables looked exciting and unique, and the waiters described them with passion. The place is pretty expensive, but definitely worth a one time visit since it's unlike any bar that I have visited. - Navya J@nyconthetableNote: I don't know how this place has been affected since COVID": "positive", "Amazing experience at Rasa!Went for a dinner date with a friend. I really enjoyed both the good and experience here. Not your typical Asian fusion rest. The flavours were so nicely curated in your mouth, we enjoyed every bite of every dish. Chopped salad, tuna tataki (must try) and the lemon thyme brownie- scrumptious. Really recommend this place , excellent ambiance and wonderful service. Great flours that we're so delightful": "positive", "came here to celebrate my birthday. The cocktails are delicious, recommend passionfruit margarita. They are tapas style, the prices may make you think you are getting an entree size but they are meant for sharing and is small portion size. They were accommodating of dietary concern and try their best to work around it or offer you an alternative. The place is packed, very little spacing between tables. I was less than an arm length from the different group next to me, if you get up to use the washroom the other person has to move or you will be touching. it was too close and made everyone in our table and the other table uncomfortable. We ordered a number of items from the menu. Truffle gnudi, steak tartare and duck confit was our favourites. However after we got home we got a stomache, it might have been the tartare, the only person who didnt have the stomache did not have the tartare. I also do not recommend the ceviche, we had high hopes for it, but the fish did not taste right. We were told it's probably the seasoning, but something just was off. A week later, i tried a different restaurant and had their sea bream also saw and it definitely tasted better and not spoiled.- brussel sprouts $16- truffle gnudi $24 (there are 4 pieces of ghnochi)- spicy ceviche $18- steak tartare $28- duck confit $28- rasa burger $21": "positive", "Absolutely incredible patio dining experience. The food was an incredible fusion of cuisines around the world. I truly enjoyed everything from the sticky ribs to the salad. This is a place you'd want to visit with a group so you can try a bit of everything from the menu! It is a tapas style restaurant so you'll want to order a couple of items per person. Even though our table was incredibly full, we still made room for their dessert which was the sticky bun. One of our friends has a severe nut allergy and the kitchen was very accommodating, modifying dishes to remove any nuts. Service was also great, the food came out one after the other so we weren't sitting around hungry. I definitely cannot wait to come back here and try the dishes that I wasn't able to the first time around": "positive", "A resounding 5 stars, people. I don't even know where to start with Rasa, everything from reservations to ambiance, food, and service was beyond all expectations. This restaurant does absolutely everything right and I will explain why we loved it so much. Firstly reservations are booked online through Bookenda, super easy and quick. Not a lot available on a Tuesday night but we snagged an 8:15pm reservation. Once booked we got a confirmation email right from the restaurant and on the day of I got a text from a real person confirming the reservation. I was even able to ask about the menu via text and got a prompt, friendly response. Super cool and convenient!We arrived and were seated at almost exactly 8:15, our waiter showed up with some water right away and explained the menu to us. We opted for the classic tasting menu having never been there before, we wanted to sample their more well-known dishes. Our server was genuine, friendly, professional and funny throughout. Him and the rest of the servers were amazing and knowledgeable about each food item. Now for the food, everything we ate from the tapioca bun to the dessert was a complete 10/10. The flavours and textures were so incredible; complex, comforting, familiar, yet new and exotic all at the same time. I couldn't believe how good everything tasted. Portion sizes were perfect and my husband and I have bigger appetites. Everything was phenomenal but our highlights were the burger and the sticky bun for dessert. I can go on all day about each individual dish but I'd be writing a novel if I did that. The restaurant is kind of cozy, rustic, but cool and modern at the same time. It's casual and down to earth. These aren't cheap eats but the value is 100% spot on. The tasting menu is $65/person but I think it was well worth it, considering dining anywhere in Toronto will often cost around that if not more. I don't know why I waited so long to dine here but it's a new favorite for sure, I'll be recommending Rasa to all my friends and family because it's too good to miss. This is a true gem and all the good reviews are truly deserved. I have not a single negative thing to say about this establishment. Overall just a genuine, delicious experience that everyone has to try!": "positive", "Came here for my birthday due to the alarmingly high stars and rave reviews (Yelp can be ruthless so this was a surprise) and was not disappointed. The great music, vibe and staff are truly want drives this place and make this establishment what it is. The staff is incredibly helpful when it comes to menu choices.So why did I dock one star? I made a reservation on OpenTable and only discovered on the day of my reservation that it was a Detroit location and that this was a known problem. Yikes. I happened to call ahead of time to let them know I was running late and was told they didn't have my name on the list. I got the feeling they would have accommodated us anyways if we did turn up because that is just the kind of people they are.I also called and left a voice message the night before asking to change my reservation time but no one got back to me. If someone did call me back we would have discovered well ahead of time that I didn't have a reservation, rather than 15 mins away from the restaurant after driving down 40 mins. Having said that, the food is great but the ceviche was a miss. Maybe it is just me but the peanut sauce was not a good mix. The chopped salad is the star of the show. The burger was great (it doesn't come with anything folks, just bun and patty so don't be looking for anything under the plates like us LOL) but the pasta was VERY salty. Got a dish with round items on it (I can't remember what it was) but it was also salty.I think my friends mentioned a few times it was my birthday. I had mentioned it too when I made the reservation. Not that I expect all restaurants to have a crew of singers, cake and confetti but a bit awkward when the table sat next to me was celebrating their birthday and my friends kept insisting \"shall we tell them again? shall we ...\" and I thought no! goodness no. Let's just go get dessert elsewhere. Verdict: I would come back but not for the food or if I was starving. I would come back for the vibe and the crowd": "positive", "Rasa is a true gem and the Food Dudes never stop innovating in the culinary department, even during a pandemic. Beloved Rasa is offering many fan favourites for pick-up and delivery, including the Chopped Salad ($15), Rasa Burger and Fries ($19) and the indulgent Sticky Bun ($13). The pork ribs with a side of coleslaw and corn bread are also a tasty option if you're in the mood to get a little messy! Good news for wine lovers, too - bottles are available for half price with any food order. The Food Dudes have also launched Bodega, an online shop with high-quality items to keep your pantry stocked and your appetite satiated.

It's one place I'm looking forward to dining at again once restrictions are lifted": "positive", "We went to Rasa for our four years anniversary and we were very lucky to be able to get a reservation at such a unique restaurant. We got their Full Experience Tasting Menu and we got an amazing 6 course meals. To start, we got an amazing chopped salad filled with chickpeas pepper, cheese and also an avocado rimmed bowl! \u00a0we also had a spicy ceviche appetizer to start too. \u00a0Both were unique, delicious and fresh! We were served a spicy pasta/Tteok-bokki with a korean fusion sauce . It was a little too spicy for me but it was too good to pass . Then we also had a fantastic duck lettuce wrap and it gave me a Chinese fusion feel. The duck was delicious too! Then, when we thought we were done, we got a Rasa Burger ! This burger was so juicy . Lastly, we finished off with a lemon thyme brownie! The thyme was super unique and the lemon was a great pairing with the brownie ! We also got two amazing cocktails. 10/10 would come back just for the drinks tbh! The cocktails were soooo good \u00a0I got the autumn margarita and my bf got the rasa spritz \u00a0if you are celebrating something special, I highly recommend coming to Rasa to celebrate !": "positive", "Excellent/perfect service and food. Speechless. Will come back soon for sure! The flavors are esquisite, juicy, exotic, just flavorful. Love it love it love it. Thank you for making me & group's night. A must try. Must come. At a loss of words for how great": "positive", "A really special night was had at Rasa. From the friendly front staff to the delicious dishes, created with care and unpretentiously presented, it was a great dining experience. I love a tapas place that provides a generous portion, which Rasa brings. Favourite dishes were the gnudi, a light gnocchi filled with potato and cheese, almost like a dumpling, celebrated with mixed mushrooms and walnut pesto. It made me pause in delight. The burger, made with beef cheek and brisket, and lifted with pickle and kimchi on a homemade black sesame sprinkled bun was scrumptious. Excellent asian chopped salad. Roasted Brussels sprouts were creamy and perfectly spiced. The ceviche was a hearty peanut sauced delight. I also love a kitchen at the front, fun to watch but not imposing. I will return again and again": "positive", "Had a splendid time. Was able to make last minute reservations and had to sit at the bar. The bartender was great! We did the tasting menu and we were stuffed! That chopped salad was so flavorful and that burger was juicy juicy. Everybody was very nice the whole time. We had a lovely experience. The music was up to date and good": "positive", "Best about Emma's:- open Mondays !!!- bacon & sausage patties - gingerbread & cinnamon roll pancakes- REAL maple syrup- \u00a0homemade donuts- fabulous & friendly staff": "positive", "My favourite brunch spot in Toronto! Everyone I know loves this place and always wants to go back. The food is amazing and the service is the best! Pictured is their classic brunch, fruit salad, and Emma's Benny. I also really love their wild berry pancakes with ricotta! Do yourself a favour and get brunch from here!The servers/hostess are so welcoming and kind as well. Also wait times are soooo worth it (pre covid of course!)": "positive", "Let me preface this review with the fact I was somehow wearing a navy shirt with black jeans today. That should say it all.I finally had time to head down to Emma's this morning. Closed for many months at the start of the pandemic, I knew that they had to be hurting. Emma's has a takeout portal on their website so I had ordered 30 minutes in advance.Ready for some cinnamon biscuits to christen my new freezer at home and to later enjoy Christmas morning, I also ordered some of their plain buttermilk biscuits. Heck since I was there anyway, a side of their delicious coffee and side of pancakes were in order.Service was friendly and quick which was great because of my parking job out front. I realized that the pancakes would not be as delicious when I would eventually get home, so I reluctantly found a nearby street to eat my pancakes. As I opened the bag I realized that I forgot to ask for cutlery. Noooooo! So I looked around the car and found 1 wrapped (clean) Starbucks straw and some napkins. Flashing back to my childhood I decided to burrito my pancakes. I used the straw to butter my pancakes and poured a tiny bit of syrup on. So burrito-ing pancakes works well with brown sugar or jam, but it is a disaster with syrup. Merde! Miraculously I had a bottle of hand sanitizer in the car, so then my whole car smelled of vanilla and candy canes.Somehow my shirt and jacket emerged unscathed. Unfortunate the coffee wasn't well suited to drinking and driving on Dufferin. Thank goodness my jeans are black and my coffee not.I share my shame to encourage you to please go to Emma's and keep this gem in business. :)": "positive", "Haven't been here since pre-covid but I recommend their sage home made sausages and wild blueberry pancakes": "positive", "One line to summarize my experience here - humble brunch done just right, delicious and hearty.I came here twice this year, one time with a larger group and another time only two of us. Tried two different items of them: first time was the Egg Benedict with peameal bacon, the second time was a stack of pancakes.Egg Benedict was done nicely: peameal bacon had crispy parts but not dry, muffin was of the right thickness, egg was runny and sauce were rich. Nothing was missing at all :DFor the pancake, I especially liked that they had ricotta cheese with lemon zest on top of pancake, it tasted refreshing and only with a subtle hint of sweetness. To me that was much better than piling up overly sweetened and fattened whipped cream which is more commonly seen for pancakes.Given the experience I can say this place scored points for both savory and sweet plates.Serving portions were generous - they kept me full for the entire morning and a half of the afternoon. Good for people with a large stomach. They also have a lot of side dish options that essentially can give you a mini version of their food - for instance, one Egg Benedict. Probably it's also fun to do some mix and match.One last note - this place gets very busy on weekends, and from what I recall they don't take reservations. So do be there early or you'll probably have to wait in the lineup": "positive", "I've come here a few more times since my last review and it's about time I update. \u00a0The food has always been really good, from the breakwich, to the peameal bacon hash (when it's on special), to the avocado toast. \u00a0I like that their pancakes change with the season. \u00a0I haven't had a chance to try them yet b/c so far they haven't had a flavour I'd like, but one day I will. \u00a0The service has always been great as well. \u00a0Very nice, accomodating, and attentive. \u00a0I took a star off b/c although I do like their biscuits, they're a bit too hard on the outside for my liking. \u00a0As a result, you have to eat the breakwich with a knife and fork so I don't hurt the roof of my mouth. \u00a0Also, it's a little expensive. \u00a0My partner and I both had coffees, he had the peameal hash, I had the breakwich, small fruit salad and we shared a side of bacon. \u00a0With tax and tip it was $70. \u00a0We like going for breakfast every other weekend, but not when we're spending that much money": "positive", "Honestly, this place is so bomb and if you don't come, you're actually missing out on life. This means if you arrive and they tell you it's going to be an hour wait, you're just going to have to wait an hour. I've actually never had to wait an hour though. I go pretty late and usually get seated almost right away. The one time I went at a more popular time (I think it was around 1:30), I waited 30-45 minutes, which really isn't bad (I'm always lining up for something). Large tables will definitely have to wait longer. I've always been a party of 2. So every time I come, I order the biscuits and gravy and that's life. This isn't something super different or out of the ordinary and if you were to break down the dish into components, ya, it's a regular breakfast but at the same time, I don't know where else I can order a biscuits and gravy dish. Why else should you order it? It's just so good, like how can you go on living without having it. How will you know what life means? It's just hot delicious gravy with sausage (?) bits in it poured over a biscuit cut in half. It comes with soft scrambled eggs and fruits. Nothing to rave over. The fruits are fine but soft scramble egggggggs, that's where it's at! Why are you so creamy and delicious? I can't live. It's just bomb. Please get it. Oh, they also give you hot sauce which you can add on if you like. I can't take the heat so no comment on how that tastes. Being the fatty that I am, I frequently get 3 dishes for 2 people so I've also had their quiche and their wild blueberry and ricotta pancakes. I am not a huge fan of pancakes \u00a0and honestly got it because everyone else around me was getting it but man, when greed does me well. I will admit I not a pancake connoisseur but these are good! If you get this (which you should), should definitely consider getting extra sauce because it's really good. The quiche was good but compared to the above two dishes, not necessary (assuming you're just one person because you can only eat so much). The breakwich, the benny, the classic is good. I don't have much to say about these but it doesn't mean it's not good. It's just compared to the pancakes and the biscuits and gravy, they're just \"good.\" However, if you're comparing this to other brunch places, these dishes are still better than theirs, so don't think you're making the wrong decision if you order these. \u00a0I haven't had everything on the menu so I can't confirm if there are any wrong choices here BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT IT. Please don't ask me about the doughnuts. They usually sell out before I get there or I just cannot possibly find any room my in stomach for them. Oh, people here are nice. I like them. Come": "positive", "Delicious breakfast! You want that in your life. Emma's specializes in breakfast seven days a week and will make sure that you leave their restaurant satisfied and happy. You might have seen them on season 4 of You Gotta Eat Here! or noticed that blogTO named them the #1 Best All-Day Breakfast in town. They're open from 8am to 3pm every day of the week - don't expect to find any sort of dinner menu here - it's breakfast and brunch comfort food all day, every day!When visiting on the weekend you can typically expect to be met with a bit of a wait to get in. They tend to move things along pretty quickly, but obviously the later that you arrive, the longer that the wait will likely be. I stopped in on a holiday Monday and the place was bumpin'. You'll usually find them open on statutory holidays when lots of other spots opt to remain closed. The restaurant is fairly unassuming from the street, with their brown signage. On the inside you'll find that the room is quite spacious, with a few tables up in the front and quite a lot more in the back. They underwent a renovation a few years ago which has really helped to maximize their space. The decor is minimal and the ambiance is warm, buzzing and welcoming.After a reasonable wait, we were seated at a table in the back section and were promptly served by the friendly wait staff.Emma's wants you to enjoy fresh comfort food and that includes; bakery items that are made fresh in-house daily, using only local meats that they cure and smoke themselves, and freshly fried donuts. The menu is filled with the delicious classics that you crave and each one is done really well. As a tea drinker, I asked for Tea ($3.00) and chose English Breakfast since I enjoy black tea in the morning. Their tea is provided by Tea Squared, a company from Canada. I prepare my black tea with milk and sugar and enjoyed a perfectly warm and pleasant cup. Can't go wrong with that! I also noted that Emma's offers some pretty awesome brunch cocktails, and the Emma's Caesar especially caught my eye. On another day when I'm feeling more \"fun\" I will certainly give it a try!There are lots of items on the menu; from their rotating (and usually seasonally appropriate) pancake flavours, to a daily quiche, to the classically southern biscuits and gravy. They've even got avocado toast for the millennials. However, their most renowned item has to be the Emma's Benny (Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, soft poached eggs and smothered in mousseline sauce. Served with a side of red skin potatoes - $16.00), a must-try. The food arrived fairly quickly and I eagerly sliced into my perfectly poached eggs. Emma's signature buttermilk biscuit is impossibly buttery and absorbs the surrounding egg yolk and mousseline m\u00e9lange decadently well. The peameal bacon is truly something special, utilizing Toronto's famous meat so well. Hormone and antibiotic free, their meats come from the best butcher in town; Sanagan's Meat Locker. Their peameal is salty and tender, a delicious protein base. What's the difference between mousseline and hollandaise sauce? It's a richer version of the classic that uses whipped cream. As if hollandaise could get any better. This benedict is like a hug of happiness for your stomach.The potatoes were fine, a little bit plain. I could have used a bit more crisp on them, but they tasted good with salt and ketchup.Emma's is pretty well-known for serving up some of the best donuts in town. Chances are that after eating a big, filling breakfast that you might not think that you have any room left for a donut. So take your donut to-go! You don't want to miss out! Their flavours change all the time (Instagram is a reliable source to find out what they've got in the case each day) and on my visit they had one of their best ones; Maple Bacon ($3.25). A lot of people are doing a maple bacon donut. It's a pretty trendy flavour. But it's my opinion that Emma's is doing the best version of it that I have ever tried. The way that they handle the bacon on this donut is by far the best. It's ultra abundant and crumbly, capturing the salty and sweet combo expertly well. If your a fan of the maple bacon donut, this is the beginning and end of it right here!Emma's Country Kitchen is a perfect little breakfast (not so) secret. They bring country flavours right into the city and serve up what you dream of for a classically delicious breakfast. You want this!": "positive", "I'm still thinking about Emma's Country Kitchen.Street parking is available. Upon entering, a kind and welcoming hostess \u00a0seated us. Our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful. All the employees here are so kind, thank you! The ambiance is laid back. Their pancakes are so fluffy and packed with flavor. Gingerbread pancakes were on the menu the day we visited and each bite was a taste of the holidays. Emma's Benny was also a hit. Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, soft poached eggs and smothered in mousseline sauce. Can't go wrong with that! Served with a side of red skin potatoes, yum. Everything tastes homemade and quality ingredients are definitely used. Their sausage is also delicious. Our little one loved it, jam packed with flavor and not overly greasy or salty. Plenty of indoor seating, but I can see this place getting incredibly packed depending on the day and time you visit. We visited a bit later in the day on a weekday and were seated immediately. Restrooms are downstairs and clean. Street parking is available. So. So. Good!": "positive", "I've been wanting to check out Emma's Country Kitchen for a while, because everything looks so damn delicious. On a recent trip to Texas, I fell in love with biscuits and gravy and I remembered that ECK had biscuits and gravy so I decided nows the time!The biscuits and gravy come with scrambled eggs, but I opted to swap those out for more sausages. The biscuits and gravy was delIcious - peppery, flavourful and not gluey at all. The biscuit Itself is really good, but is not like a traditional buttermilk biscuit that is crumbly or salty. I actually prefer that type of biscuit, but that's a whole other story. The hot sauce that comes on the side is a must have - nice and spicy and compliments everything very well.If I had ONE criticism about ECK - it's the drinks. We had orange juice wIth our meal and it was 6$ a GLASS. No refills. I get it's fresh squeezed but that's pretty expensive. I'll likely go back for more B&G and to try other menu options because the food was really good and comforting, and was nap inducing which was great for a Sunday afternoon :)": "positive", "Great place for drink and chat afterwork. Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't crowded at all. The inside was smaller than I thought, but nice that they have a patio.Apero was good, fries were so-so. Maybe will try their burger next time": "positive", "The beer bistro was very good for a drink and quick bite. We sat on the patio which is set up off the main street. It is very pretty with a cool, low key ambiance. They have a pretty extensive beer selection which was the major appeal of coming here. I got a pear cider which is a little different, but it was pretty tasty. For food, I ordered the pear and brie flat bread pizza. It wasn't anything to write home about, but pretty good for food. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the burger. It was juicy and flavorful. It was a standard burger and delicious. The fries were pretty good too. They were crispy, but some were a little overdone. Not as bad as I've seen at some places, but adds a bit of a bitter bite. Overall, I would absolutely check this place out for a late night drink and maybe something to share later in the evening": "positive", "I'm going to start with the negatives first, one it is way overpriced and two the waiter needs more training or needs to be fired, he told me my payment didn't go through but when I checked it did, I didn't really appreciate it that, but anyways now the negatives are gone let's start with the positives I ordered the braised beef angliotti, didn't have to wait too long, it had spinach and the beef short rib was perfectly tender and meshed well with the pasta, that sauce was dynamite, I don't eat carbs so I consider this my cheat day, but the price was a bit too steep for the portion size they give and charging 30 bucks this is a complete rip off, that felt like a snack, but anyways quality over quantity it tasted really good just melts in your mouth, I won't really go ou to fly way to come here again cuz it's far but anyone who loves meat here definitely come check it out": "positive", "The service is good , location is convenient and the tables are well spaced. Food is only ok though, good beer selection but not a standout downtown": "positive", "Great late night bar with good late night food. The bartenders are very attentive. I got a set of flights of their local beer, which was very good": "positive", "I came to Beerbistro for dinner with a group of friends after work. We made a reservation for 8+ people and they accommodated us well. Started off with the fondue as an appetizer. The waitress said it feeds 2-4 which I think is pretty accurate depending on how much people eat. The cheese was flavorful and smooth, and included a good mix of different cheeses (not sure which ones though). The bread was dry but okay to eat when drowned in cheese and I think they give you free refills. For the main, I had the hog wild flatbread. The pizza dough was chewy and grilled well, but the bbq sauce was a bit too sweet for me. The confit whole garlic pieces were the highlight of the flatbread. My friend ordered the beef curry which was delicious.Beerbistro has a huge selection of beer (duh) and some local beers that are worth trying. Overall I had a fun dinner and would recommend for a casual meal with good company!": "positive", "It has been seven years since my first review of Beer Bistro so an update review is a 'must.' There have been subsequent visits since then. Somewhere within the seven years, I've even had a birthday dinner here.Firstly, the location is great. The restaurant is literally steps away from King Station and a few blocks from Union. It's a great meeting point that's easy to find. There are also a lot of post-dinner coffee spots around here, including a Starbucks by the station, Shy Coffee, and Marche down the street. Secondly, the service is consistently good. At the table, they are very attentive and seem to know the food menu well. They are also very knowledgeable about beer. I came here with a friend visiting from out of town and she was recommended a lovely beer based on her tastes. Thirdly (and most importantly), the food is quite good. If at Beer Bistro, ordering mussels are a must! They have a flavor for every palette. I also recommend an order of the fries - they are perfectly crispy.Good for: beer, mussels, frites, after work drinks": "positive", "Tried Beerbistro and good say not so bad. Some good bar food. Ordered some mussels which were very yummy with there sauce which you can take off all the mussels and make it a mussel soup delicious. They got a bunch of beers on tap and bottle not really a beer guy but they had a nice variety. See you next time": "positive", "Found this place after browsing a bit on Yelp, trying to find a late night place nearby to grab a drink. I was immediately drawn to Beerbistro because of their large selection on their draught list. And the option to get a flight for only $7! We were interested in trying some of the local/Canadian beers, so it was great that they had the flight option. They have 3 special drinks they they call \"The Taps of the Moment\", which are \"single keg offerings of specific styles\". As per their website, they had:1 THE BEER OF THE MOMENT2 THE FOUNDERS BREWING ROTATIONAL TAP3 ONTARIO CIDER OF THE MOMENTWe also got the drunchies so obviously got an order of Belgian frites ($7) with smoked tomato ketchup and house made mayo sauce. My god, it went SO well with the beers. And it was sizeable!! I love my fries, but I'm glad I shared it. They had a chill atmosphere, with tvs situated around the bar and restaurant, so I'm sure this is a great place to gather to watch games. I could even see myself coming here to get a drink and do work in the corner, at one of the high tops. I'm still uncertain about the \"Late Night\" menu that is on their website. We arrived about an hour or two before closing, but they gave us the normal food menu when I asked about the late night menu - not sure if that's still a thing. I'd come back for the drinks and fries, but not sure about their actual food menu, as it is pricier than I'd be willing to spend": "positive", "Beerbistro is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. Every time I visit Toronto, I try to get here at least once. I love the atmosphere at the bar and in the restaurant itself, but my favorite spot is the little booths with tables in the bar area. It's just so cozy! The tap list is amazing and there are also many bottles to choose from, as well as wines and other cocktails. Not only is the booze great, but the food is not an afterthought! My husband and I split the Belgian frites and duck salad and we each got a butternut squash soup. My mouth is watering just thinking about all of it! The fries were plentiful (so many fries!!) and super tasty but not greasy at all. They were served with mayo and smoked ketchup and I just couldn't get enough. Then the duck salad came and it was the perfect combination of flavors, plus the duck was cooked perfectly. When I thought I might burst, the butternut squash soup came and it was so delicious that I devoured every mouthful. It actually tasted like butternut squash and was not overly seasoned or salted. The waitstaff are always top notch and even when it's busy I never feel abandoned. My only minor complaint was that they stopped serving gluten free pizza but never took it off the menu. Still, I can't wait to come back next year! I'm already making room in my belly for all those fries!!": "positive", "Antler has been on my Toronto Food Bucket List for ages. It looks like they take game meats & transform it to rustic fine dining. We got their Duck Heart Yakitori (3.5/5) & Wild Mushroom Tart (4.5/5) to start. The duck heart wasn't as liver-like as I thought and the texture was interesting, overall was a wild-card try for us! The mushroom tart was just super savoury and every component was delicious. Then we got a Bison Rib Eye (4.5/5) to share, overall tasted like a great steak to me! We already have our eyes out to try their signature Wild Boar Cavatelli next time": "positive", "We've been wanting to try Antler for quite sometime, this Christmas they offered a Christmas at home box so we figured we will give it a go. For take home box, first off, portion is generous, it can easily feed 6. However, the instructions can use quite a lot of improvement. We have done take home boxes at different edtablishments, this is the first time I have to taste test the little container first before I am sure to put it in with the course. There was almost no label. Only items labeled were the most obvious ones like \"compote\" and \"shaved carrots\". All the creamy beige color containers? Nope. Which one is ricotta, which one is buttercream? What is the difference between gremolata vs chimichurri? Internet picks shows both green, as non professional cook, which is which? Oh well, I took a wild guess. For the food, we really enjoyed the bison tenderloin and the mushroom. Both meets expectations. Plum pudding was a very pleasant surprised. I personally an no bread pudding fan, but I really enjoyed the dessert. The flamb\u00e9 added so much fun to the prep process and the buttercream really kicks it up a notch. Liver parfait was a bit bland, those crostini were unfortunately hard rock. (I substituted them with my own crackers). But the carrot salad... the carrot salad was a disappointment. All three kinds of carrots were crunch crunch crunch. Even the charred carrots which I was hoping would be fully cooked and add a bit of softening texture to the dish, but no! Solid crunch. The chimichurri/ gremolata just didn't give enough flavor to turn tie all the crunchy sticks together and I have no idea why the ricotta. I served only half the portion but we just could not finish the plate and chucked half the salad. I would have given their rating 3.5 if I can do half star. But leaned towards to 3 based on the price of the box, I was expecting more wowing dish or at least not a single overwhelming (unpleasant) dish": "positive", "After I dined at Antler about 3 years ago, it was on my list of favourite restaurants so I recently returned to see if my memories where misguided. They weren't, the place is still fantastic! \u00a0Started the evening with a tasty whiskey based cocktail, All Spruced Up. \u00a0Appetizers consisted of the Charcuterie & Cheese Board along with the Elk Tartare. \u00a0Both good choices to go along with the bottle of Washington Cabernet, fairly priced at ~$70. \u00a0I had the Duck Confit as a main, which was tender and placed on a well balanced pur\u00e9e with lentils. \u00a0Finished with a not-overly sweet (a good thing) Orange and Pistachio cake. \u00a0Service was excellent and the ambiance was fine inside obviously way more space between tables than before so it doesn't feel like you're on the TCC at rush hour. \u00a0All in all, a great restaurant for meat lovers where you get top quality food without melting your credit card. \u00a0Still a top pick when in the mood for meat": "positive", "Dined for a romantic evening and had just that! Food was great, every course was cooked to perfection. \u00a0The cocktails we enjoyed were also delicious. \u00a0The only downside was the air conditioning was either broken or inadequate for heat from the kitchen. \u00a0We have enjoyed several of their take home boxes over the course of the pandemic and use their cookbook often! Can't wait for our next dinner at Antler!": "positive", "I was craving some gamey meats when I stumbled upon this gem online. The bison ribeye stood out to me and it did not disappoint! Would definitely recommend Antler and will be returning in the future.The restaurant itself has an interesting lodge house / outback feel although we only had the option to dine at their patio. Their patio dining is inside a tent with a heater in the middle which didn't do much to warm the tent so dress warmly if it's chilly and you plan to dine at Antler.The food itself was fantastic, we ordered the charcuterie board as an appetizer which came with some interesting spreads, cheeses, and meats (duck, boar, etc.) - this is a must try. They also had a maple syrup brandy drink which was really good. For my entree, I ordered the bison ribeye and it was amazing. While I thought it might've been tough and gamey vs. beef, it was surprisingly tender and flavourful! Not sure whether this is typical of bison meat or a product of the chef's cooking - I'll attribute it to the latter.Overall an interesting experience and one worth trying!": "positive", "I was fortunate enough to be able to dine in Antler's outdoor hunt camp before the shut down mid-November. I've heard a lot about the place and was super excited about being able to secure a last minute reservation. The staff there were very friendly and accommodating.We ordered elk tartare and foie gras to start and game burger and venision striploin for mains. Everything was fantastic, seasoned to perfection. We especially enjoyed the venison striploin and elk tartare. I can't recommend Antler enough!": "positive", "Every time I come to this restaurant, I think: \"it must not be as good as I remember it\" and every single time, it's better": "positive", "Got the charcuterie to start, and the bread/cracker that was provided was extremely stale and rock hard. Couldn't bite into it without struggling like you were biting into a piece of cement. I think they toasted them a bit too much and left them out before serving, and since they were thin and no longer fresh (was cold, not warm), it quickly hardened (but not to a crisp). Very strange experience for a high-end restaurant to mess up a basic cracker/bread. Still gave it 3 stars though as the rest of the dishes were pretty good, but not great. Unfortunately, I was very hyped to try this place, and brought my fiance here for his birthday, but it fell short of our expectations. Maybe they were having an off day": "positive", "Just had dinner here on a whim and it was way better than expected. We went with no expectations and we were blown away. The Ribeye was so delicious, and the cavatelli (? spelling - too lazy to google) was very hot considering how cold it was outside. Fries were offered with salivating duck fat aioli and the side greens were so good I gave myself a stomachache from not sharing enough. There's a watermelon cocktail on the drink list that you should also look for - very refreshing and not too sweet": "positive", "Ordered the charcuterie kit! Really enjoyed trying different meats, however much more difficult to enjoy from home vs. the restaurant. Ordered the \"large\" charcuterie and expected more varietyThe meats were quite buttery, definitely not for everyone": "positive"}
